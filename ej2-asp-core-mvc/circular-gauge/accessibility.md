# Accessibility in Circular Gauge component

Circular Gauge has built-in accessibility features like screen reading and WAI-ARIA attributes.

| Attributes | Purpose |

| `role=region` | It is specified in the pointer where the interactive drag and drop function is supported to update the pointer value. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the axis labels, legend title, legend item label, text pointer and annotation. |

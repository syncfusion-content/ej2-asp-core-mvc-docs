# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## Sidebar component

The Sidebar component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Sidebar component is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Sidebar component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) patterns to meet accessibility standards. By default, the Sidebar utilizes the [complementary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/complementary_role) role, with the option to modify the ARIA role based on provided attributes to the root element, depending on the specific use case.
 
If there are multiple complementary landmark roles or aside elements in a document, it is important to provide a label for each landmark using the `aria-label` attribute. Alternatively, if the aside has a descriptive title, it can be referenced using the `aria-labelledby` attribute. This label will help assistive technology users quickly understand the purpose of each landmark.
 
For optimal accessibility, it is recommended to incorporate a trigger component that is navigable via a keyboard, such as a button. If this is not feasible, inclusion of the `tabIndex` attribute becomes necessary. Furthermore, explicit handling of the `aria-expanded` attribute is required for the trigger element.

## Keyboard interaction

The Sidebar component does not have any inbuilt keyboard interaction support. However, you can utilize the keyboard interactions of focusable elements within the Sidebar component.

## Ensuring accessibility

The Sidebar component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

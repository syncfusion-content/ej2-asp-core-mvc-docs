# Upgrading Syncfusion ASP .NET Core EJ2 NuGet packages to a latest version

Every three months, Syncfusion releases new volumes with interesting new features. For this volume, there will be weekly NuGet releases and a service pack. Syncfusion ASP.NET Core JS2 NuGet packages are released on a weekly basis to address critical issue fixes.

From any Syncfusion ASP.NET Core JS2 NuGet version you have installed; you can update to our most recent version.

## Upgrade NuGet packages through Package Manager UI

The NuGet **Package Manager UI** in Visual Studio allows to easily install, uninstall, and update NuGet packages in applications and solutions. You can find and upgrade the Syncfusion ASP.NET Core JS2 NuGet packages to the most recent version or to specific version in the ASP.NET Core solution or application and this process is easy with the steps below:

1. Right-click on the ASP.NET Core application or solution in the Solution Explorer tab, and choose **Manage NuGet Packages...**

    As an alternative, after opening the ASP.NET Core application in Visual Studio, go to the **Tools** menu and after hovering **NuGet Package Manager**, select **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...**

2. The Manage NuGet Packages window will open. Navigate to the **Updates** tab, then search for the Syncfusion ASP.NET Core JS2 NuGet packages using a term like **"Syncfusion"** and select the appropriate Syncfusion ASP.NET Core JS2 NuGet package for your application.

    > The [nuget.org](https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json) package source is selected by default in the Package source drop-down. If your Visual Studio does not have nuget.org configured, follow the instructions in the [Microsoft documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/package-manager-ui#package-sources) to set up the nuget.org feed URL.

3. By default, the package is selected with the latest version. You can select the required version and click the **Update** button and accept the license terms. The package will be upgraded to selected version in your ASP.NET Core application.

## Installation using Dotnet (.NET) CLI

The [dotnet Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-dotnet-cli), allows you to add, restore, pack, publish, and manage packages without making any changes to your application files. [Dotnet add package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package?tabs=netcore2x) adds a package reference to the application file, then runs [dotnet restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore?tabs=netcore2x) to install the package.

Follow the below instructions to use the dotnet CLI command to install the Syncfusion ASP.NET Core JS2 NuGet packages.

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where your ASP.NET Core web application project file is located.
2. To install a NuGet package, run the following command.

    ```dotnet add package <Package name>```

    **For Example:**
    dotnet add package Syncfusion.EJ2.AspNet.Core

    N> If you donâ€™t provide a version flag, this command will be upgrading to the latest version by default. To specify a version, add the -v parameter: dotnet add package Syncfusion.EJ2.AspNet.Core -v 19.2.0.57

3. Examine the ASP.NET Core project file after the command has completed to ensure that the Syncfusion ASP.NET Core JS2 package was installed. To see the added reference, open the .csproj file.

    N> Restoring is done automatically with **dotnet build** and **dotnet run** in .NET Core 2.0 and later.

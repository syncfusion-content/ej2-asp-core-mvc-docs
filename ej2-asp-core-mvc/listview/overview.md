# Overview

The ListView component represents the data in interactive hierarchical structure interface across different layouts or views, that also has features such as data-binding, template, grouping and Virtualization.

## Key Features

* **[Data binding](../../listview/data-binding/)**: Supports data binding to display the list of items from the local or server-side data source.

* **[Grouping](../../listview/grouping/)**: Provides support to group the logically related items under a category.

* **[Nested list](../../listview/nested-list/)**:  Displays a set of nested list items in different layout.

* **[Customizing templates](../../listview/customizing-templates/)**: Allows you to customize the list item, header, and category group header.

* **[Virtualization](../../listview/virtualization/)**: Allows you to load only viewable list items in a view port which will increase ListView performance on loading large number of data.

* **[Accessibility](../../accessibility/)**: Provides built-in accessibility support that helps to access all the ListView component features through the keyboard, on-screen readers, or other assistive technology devices.

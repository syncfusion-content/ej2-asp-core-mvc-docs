# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## ListView component

<style>

        display: inline-block;
        margin: 0.5em 0;

<div><img src="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/images/landing-page/yes.png" alt="Yes"> - All features of the component meet the requirement.</div>

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The ListView component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the ListView component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=list` | Specifies the non selectable list container. |
| `role=listitem`| Specifies the role of each item in a selectable ListView and its containment within the list. |
| `role=presentation` | Specifies the role of non selectable list element. |
| `role=checkbox` | Indicates checkbox control along with listitem element. |
| `aria-checked` | Indicates the current checked state of checkbox. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the ListView Checkbox. |
| `aria-disabled` | Indicates element is perceivable but disabled. |

## Keyboard interaction

The ListView component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the ListView component.

| Keyboard shortcuts | Actions |
|------------|-------------------|
| <kbd>Arrow Up</kbd> | Move to the previous list item |
| <kbd>Arrow Down</kbd> | Move to the next list item |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | Check and uncheck the targeted list from the whole list |
| <kbd>BackSpace</kbd> | Get back to the previous lists if it is nested list |
| <kbd>Home</kbd> | Moves focus to first list item |
| <kbd>End</kbd> | Moves focus to last list item |

## Ensuring accessibility

The ListView component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the ListView component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/list-view.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the ListView component with accessibility tools.

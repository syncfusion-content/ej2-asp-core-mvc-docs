# Toast Component Accessibility 

The Toast control has been designed with [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/) specifications in mind by applying the prompt WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties with the keyboard support. It helps users who use assistive WAI-ARIA accessibility support, which is achieved using attributes.

It provides information about the elements in a document for assistive technology.

The Toast control implements the keyboard navigation support by using the following [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) and is tested in major screen readers.

The Toast component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Toast component is outlined below.

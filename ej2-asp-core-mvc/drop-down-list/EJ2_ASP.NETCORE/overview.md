# Overview

The DropDownList control contains a list of predefined values from which a single value can be chosen. The functionality of DropDownList resembles the SELECT form element of HTML. When an arrow icon accompanied with this control is pressed, the dropdown displays a list of values from which you can select one.

## Key features

* **[Data binding](./data-binding/)** - Allows binding and accessing the list of items from local or server-side data source.

* **[Grouping](./grouping/)** -  Supports grouping of logically related items under a single or specific category.

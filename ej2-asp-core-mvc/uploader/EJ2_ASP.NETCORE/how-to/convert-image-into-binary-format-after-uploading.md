# Convert image into binary format in ASP.NET Core Uploader

By default, the file upload control saves the uploaded image files in physical directories. Also, you can convert the images into binary format at server-side before saving the uploaded images.

To retrieve binary format of image files, convert the posted fileâ€™s input stream into binary reader and read as bytes using ReadBytes method.

Refer to the below server-side code snippet

``` csharp

[[AcceptVerbs("Post")]
public IActionResult Save(IList<IFormFile> UploadFiles)
{
    IFormFile uploadedImage = UploadFiles.FirstOrDefault();
    if (uploadedImage.ContentType.ToLower().StartsWith("image/"))
    // Check whether the selected file is image
    {
        byte[] b;
        using (BinaryReader br = new BinaryReader(uploadedImage.OpenReadStream()))
        {
            b = br.ReadBytes((int)uploadedImage.OpenReadStream().Length);
            // Convert the image in to bytes
        }
        Response.StatusCode = 200;
    }
    return Content("");
}

```

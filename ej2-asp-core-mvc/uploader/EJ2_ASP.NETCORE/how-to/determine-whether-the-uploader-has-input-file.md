# Determine whether uploader has file input (required validation)

By setting **required** attribute to uploader input element, you can validate the file input has any value in it. 
In the below sample, set required attribute to the uploader input element and showcase the validation failure message using `data-required-message` attribute.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/required/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Index.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/required/index.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/required/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Index.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/required/index.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

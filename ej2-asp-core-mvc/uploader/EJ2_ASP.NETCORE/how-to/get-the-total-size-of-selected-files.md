# Get the total size of selected files

You can get the total size of selected files before uploading it to the designated server. This can be achieved by using the [selected](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Inputs.Uploader.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Inputs_Uploader_Selected) event. Refer to the following example to calculate the total file size.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/file-size/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Index.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/file-size/index.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/file-size/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Index.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/file-size/index.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

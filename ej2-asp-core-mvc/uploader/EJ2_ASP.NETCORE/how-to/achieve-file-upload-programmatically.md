# Achieve file upload programmatically

You can upload a file programmatically using upload method. The selected files data, get from getFilesData public method in uploader.

The upload method behaves differently based on its arguments.
* If this method receives any files as arguments, those files only start to upload.
* If it has no argument then all the selected files are will start to upload.

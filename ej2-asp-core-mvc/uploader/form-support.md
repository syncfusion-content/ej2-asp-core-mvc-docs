# Forms Support (Synchronous Upload)

The Uploader control works with HTML form like default file input. The following configuration is must to make the Uploader work inside the form.

* `saveUrl` and `removeUrl` must be null.
* `autoUpload` must be disabled.
* `name` attribute must be added in input element.

The selected or dropped files are received as a collection in form action when the form is submitted. The form action handles the server-side operations that manage the file upload process. When you reset the form, the file list and data will be cleared.

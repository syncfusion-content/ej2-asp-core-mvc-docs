# Open and edit the uploaded files

The uploader control allows you to modify the file after uploading to the server, which can be achieved using [success](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Inputs.Uploader.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Inputs_Uploader_Success) event of the uploader.

You can retrieve the saved file path in the uploader success event and assign it to custom attribute (data-file-name) value of the respective file list element to open the uploaded file. Click the respective file element to create a new request along with saved file path using http header. In the server-side, get the file path from the header and open the file using `process.start` method.

# Check file size before uploading it

By using [uploading](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Inputs.Uploader.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Inputs_Uploader_Uploading) event, you can get the file size before upload it to server. 
File object contains the file size in bytes only. 
You can convert the size to standard formats (`KB` or `MB`) using **bytesToSize** method.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/check-file-size/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Index.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/check-file-size/index.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/check-file-size/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Index.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/check-file-size/index.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

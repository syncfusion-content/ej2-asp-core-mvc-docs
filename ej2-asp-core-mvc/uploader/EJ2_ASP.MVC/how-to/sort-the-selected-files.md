# Sort the selected files

You can sort the selected files in uploader control by using the [selected](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Inputs.Uploader.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Inputs_Uploader_Selected) event. Refer to the following example.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/sorting/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Index.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/sorting/index.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/sorting/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Index.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/sorting/index.css %}
{% endhighlight %}

## WAI-ARIA attributes

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following list of ARIA attributes is used in Query Builder.

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role` | Indicates the query builder component. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Query Builder component followed the keyboard interaction guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Query Builder component.

| **Press** | **To do this** |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Tab / Shift + Tab</kbd> | To focus the next item in the rule. |

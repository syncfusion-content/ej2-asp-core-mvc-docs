# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## Toolbar control

The Toolbar control has been designed,  keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/toolbar/) specifications, and applying the WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties along with keyboard support for people who use assistive devices. WAI-ARIA accessibility support is achieved through attributes like `aria-label`, and `aria-orientation`, It provides information about elements in a document for assistive technology.  The control implements keyboard navigation support by following the [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/), and has been tested in major screen readers.

The accessibility compliance for the Toolbar control is outlined below.

## Ensuring accessibility

The Toolbar control accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Toolbar control is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/toolbar.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Toolbar control with accessibility tools.

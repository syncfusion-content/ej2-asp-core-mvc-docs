# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## Toolbar Component

The Toolbar component has been designed,  keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/toolbar/) specifications, and applying the WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties along with keyboard support for people who use assistive devices. WAI-ARIA accessibility support is achieved through attributes like `aria-label`, and `aria-orientation`, It provides information about elements in a document for assistive technology.  The component implements keyboard navigation support by following the [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/), and has been tested in major screen readers.

The accessibility compliance for the Toolbar component is outlined below.

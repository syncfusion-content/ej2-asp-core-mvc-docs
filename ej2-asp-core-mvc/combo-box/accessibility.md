# Accessibility in Combo Box Control

The ComboBox control has been designed, keeping in mind the `WAI-ARIA` specifications, and applies the WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties along with `keyboard support`. This control is characterized by complete keyboard interaction support and ARIA accessibility support that makes it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) or those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

## ARIA attributes

The ComboBox control uses the `combobox` role, and each list item has an `option` role. The following `ARIA attributes` denotes the ComboBox state.

| **Properties** | **Functionalities** |
| --- | --- |
| aria-haspopup | Indicates whether the ComboBox input element has a popup list or not. |
| aria-expanded | Indicates whether the popup list has expanded or not. |
| aria-selected | Indicates the selected option. |
| aria-readonly | Indicates the readonly state of the ComboBox element. |
| aria-disabled | Indicates whether the ComboBox control is in a disabled state or not. |
| aria-activedescendent | This attribute holds the ID of the active list item to focus its descendant child element. |
| aria-owns | This attribute contains the ID of the popup list to indicate popup as a child element. |
| aria-autocomplete | This attribute contains ‘both’ to a list of options shows and the currently selected suggestion also shows inline. |

## Keyboard interaction

You can use the following key shortcuts to access the ComboBox without interruptions.

| **Keyboard shortcuts** | **Actions** |

| <kbd>Shift + tab </kbd> | Focuses on the previous TabIndex element on the page when the popup is closed. Otherwise, closes the popup list and remains the focus of the control. |

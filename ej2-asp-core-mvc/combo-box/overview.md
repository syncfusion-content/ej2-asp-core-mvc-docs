# Overview

The ComboBox control allows the user to type a value or choose an option from the list of predefined options.
When an arrow icon accompanied with this control is pressed, the dropdown displays a list of values, from which the user can select one.

## Key features

* **[Custom values](getting-started.html#custom-values)** - Allows setting user-defined values that is not in the popup list.

* **[Grouping](grouping.html)** - Supports grouping of logically related items under a single or specific category.

* **[Sorting](api-comboBox.html#sortorder-sortorder)** - Supports sorting of list items in an alphabetical order (either ascending or descending).

* **[Filtering](filtering.html)** - Allows filtering of list items based on a character typed in the control.

* **[Templates](templates.html)** - Allows customizing the list items, selected value, header, footer, category group header, and no records content.

* **[Accessibility](accessibility.html)** - Provided with built-in accessibility support that helps to access all the ComboBox control features through the keyboard, screen readers, or other assistive technology devices.

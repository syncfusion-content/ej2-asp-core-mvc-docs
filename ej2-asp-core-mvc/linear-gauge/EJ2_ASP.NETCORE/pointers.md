# Pointers in ASP.NET Core Linear Gauge

Pointers are used to indicate values on an axis. The value of the pointer can be modified using the [`Value`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugePointer_Value) property in [`e-lineargauge-pointer`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html).

## Types of pointer

The Linear Gauge supports the following types of pointers:

* Bar
* Marker

The type of pointer can be modified by using the [`Type`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugePointer_Type) property in [`e-lineargauge-pointer`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html).

### Marker pointer

A marker pointer is a shape that can be used to mark the pointer value in the Linear Gauge.

<b>Types of marker shapes</b>

By default, the marker shape for the pointer is **InvertedTriangle**. To change the shape of the pointer, use the [`MarkerType`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugePointer_MarkerType) property in [`e-lineargauge-pointer`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html). The following marker types are available in Linear Gauge.

* Circle
* Rectangle
* Triangle
* InvertedTriangle
* Diamond
* Image

An image can be rendered instead of rendering a shape as a pointer. It can be achieved by setting the [`MarkerType`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugePointer_MarkerType) property to **Image** and setting the source URL of image to [`ImageUrl`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugePointer_ImageUrl) property in [`e-lineargauge-pointer`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html).

**Marker pointer customization**

The marker pointer can be customized using the following properties and class.

### Bar pointer

The bar pointer is used to track the axis value. The bar pointer starts from the beginning of the gauge and ends at the pointer value. To enable bar pointer set the [`Type`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugePointer_Type) property in [`e-lineargauge-pointer`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html) as **Bar**.

## Multiple pointers

Multiple pointers can be added to the Linear Gauge by adding multiple [`e-lineargauge-pointer`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html) in the [`e-lineargauge-pointer`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointers.html) and customization for the pointers can be done with [`e-lineargauge-pointer`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html).

## Pointer animation

Pointer is animated on loading the gauge. This can be handled using the [`AnimationDuration`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugePointer.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugePointer_AnimationDuration) property. The duration of the animation can be specified in milliseconds.

## Gradient Color

Gradient support allows the addition of multiple colors in the pointers of the Linear Gauge. The following gradient types are supported in the Linear Gauge.

* Linear Gradient
* Radial Gradient

### Linear Gradient

Using linear gradient, colors will be applied in a linear progression. The start value of the linear gradient can be set using the [`StartValue`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeLinearGradient.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeLinearGradient_StartValue) property. The end value of the linear gradient will be set using the [`EndValue`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeLinearGradient.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeLinearGradient_EndValue) property. The color stop values such as [`Color`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeColorStop.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeColorStop_Color), [`Opacity`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeColorStop.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeColorStop_Opacity), and [`Offset`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeColorStop.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeColorStop_Offset) are set using [`ColorStop`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeLinearGradient.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeLinearGradient_ColorStop) property.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}



![Linear Gauge with linear gradient pointer](../linear-gauge/images/linear-pointer.png)

### Radial Gradient

Using radial gradient, colors will be applied in circular progression. The inner circle position of the radial gradient will be set using the [`InnerPosition`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeRadialGradient.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeRadialGradient_InnerPosition) property. The outer circle position of the radial gradient can be set using the [`OuterPosition`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeRadialGradient.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeRadialGradient_OuterPosition) property. The color stop values such as [`Color`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeColorStop.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeColorStop_Color), [`Opacity`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeColorStop.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeColorStop_Opacity), and [`Offset`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeColorStop.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeColorStop_Offset) are set using [`ColorStop`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeRadialGradient.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeRadialGradient_ColorStop) property.

{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}



![Linear Gauge with radial gradient pointer](../linear-gauge/images/radial-pointer.png)

N>If we set both gradients, only the linear gradient gets rendered. If we set the [`StartValue`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeLinearGradient.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeLinearGradient_StartValue) and [`EndValue`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeLinearGradient.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_LinearGauge_LinearGaugeLinearGradient_EndValue) of the [`LinearGradient`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.LinearGauge.LinearGaugeLinearGradient.html) as empty strings, then the radial gradient gets rendered in the pointer of the Linear Gauge.

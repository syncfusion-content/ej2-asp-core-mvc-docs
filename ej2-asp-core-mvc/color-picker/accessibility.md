## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Color picker component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Color picker component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role` | Indicates the Color picker component as `color`and the tiles as `gridcell` in the color palette. |
| `aria-label` | Indicates the accessible name for the tiles. |
| `aria-selected` | Indicates the current selected state of the tile. |
| `aria-haspopup` | Indicates the availability of the popup element. |
| `aria-expanded` | Indicates whether the popup can be expanded or collapsed, as well as indicates whether its current state is expanded or collapsed. |
| `aria-owns` | Identifies an elements in order to define a visual, functional, or contextual parent/child relationship between DOM elements where the DOM hierarchy cannot be used to represent the relationship. |
| `aria-disabled` | Indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not editable or otherwise operable. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Color picker component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Color picker component.

| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> | Moves the handler/tile up from the current position. |
| <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> | Moves the handler/tile down from the current position. |
| <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> | Moves the handler/tile left from the current position. |
| <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> | Moves the handler/tile right from the current position. |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Apply the selected color value. |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | To focus the next focusable element in the Color picker popup. |

# Accessibility of Slider Control

The [ASP.NET Core Slider](https://www.syncfusion.com/aspnet-core-ui-controls/range-slider) is characterized with complete ARIA Accessibility support that helps to access by on-screen readers and other assistive technology devices. This control is designed with the reference of guidelines document given in the [WAI ARAI Accessibility Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#slider).

The Slider control uses the Slider role and the following ARIA properties for its element based on the state.

| **Properties** | **Functionalities** |

| `aria-valuenow` | It Indicates the current value of the slider. |
| `aria-valuetext`| Returns the current text of the slider. |
| `aria-valuemin` | It Indicates the Minimum value of the slider. |
| `aria-valuemax` | It Indicates the Maximum value of the slider. |
| `aria-orientation` | It Indicates the Slider Orientation. |
| `aria-label` | Slider left and right button label text (increment and decrement). |
| `aria-labelledby` | It indicates the name of the Slider. |

# Floating panels

The floating functionality of the component allows to effectively use the entire layout for the panel's placement. If the floating functionality is enabled, the panels within the layout get floated upwards automatically to occupy the empty cells available in previous rows. This functionality can be enabled or disabled using the [`allowFloating`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Layouts.DashboardLayout~AllowFloating.html) property of the component.

The following sample demonstrates how to enable or disable the floating of panels in the DashboardLayout component using [`allowFloating`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Layouts.DashboardLayout~AllowFloating.html) property.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/floating-panels/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="HomeController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/floating-panels/HomeController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/floating-panels/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="HomeController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/floating-panels/HomeController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}



When [`allowFloating`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Layouts.DashboardLayout~AllowFloating.html) value set as false, the output is like the below.

# Accessibility

The Dashboard Layout component has been designed with keeping the `WAI-ARIA` specifications in mind and applying the `WAI-ARIA` roles, states, and properties. This component is characterized by ARIA accessibility support, which makes navigation easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT).

## ARIA attributes

The following `ARIA` Attribute denotes the Dashboard Layout state.

| **Property** | **Functionalities** |
| --- | --- |
| aria-grabbed | Indicates whether the attribute is set to true. It has been selected for dragging. If this attribute is set to false, the element can be grabbed for a drag-and-drop operation, but will not be currently grabbed.|

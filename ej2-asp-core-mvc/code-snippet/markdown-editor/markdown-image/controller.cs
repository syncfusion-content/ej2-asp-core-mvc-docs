Markdown is not like that. When you format the word in Markdown format, you need to add Markdown syntax to the word to indicate which words 
and phrases should look different from each other.

RichTextEditor supports markdown editing when the editorMode set as **markdown** and using both *keyboard interaction* and *toolbar action*, you can apply the formatting to text.

We can add our own custom formation syntax for the Markdown formation.

The third-party library <b>Marked</b> is used in this sample to convert markdown into HTML content";

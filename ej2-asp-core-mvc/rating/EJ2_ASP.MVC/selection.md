# Selection in ASP.NET MVC Rating Control

The ASP.NET MVC Rating control allows users to rate something using a visual scale, and the selection state can be changed by the user clicking or tapping on the stars in the rating scale or through code. The Rating control has a minimum value and a reset button, and provides customization options for the selected rating value and selection behavior.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/rating/selection/selection/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Selection.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/rating/selection/selection/selection.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% endif %}

## Min value

You can use the [Min](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Inputs.Rating.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Inputs_Rating_Min) property of the ASP.NET MVC Rating control to set the minimum possible rating value the user can select. If you set the `Min` property to 2, then you will not be able to select a rating lower than 2.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/rating/selection/min/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Min.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/rating/selection/min/min.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% endif %}

## Single selection

You can use the [EnableSingleSelection](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Inputs.Rating.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Inputs_Rating_EnableSingleSelection) property of the ASP.NET MVC Rating control to select only one item at a time. When the `EnableSingleSelection` property is set to `true`, only the selected item will be considered to be in the selected state, while all other items will be unselected.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/rating/selection/single-selection/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="SingleSelection.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/rating/selection/single-selection/singleselection.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% endif %}

## Show or hide reset button

You can reset the rating value to its default by using the [AllowReset](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Inputs.Rating.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Inputs_Rating_AllowReset) property of the ASP.NET MVC Rating control. When the `AllowReset` property is set to `true`, a reset button will be shown that allows the user to reset the rating value to its default.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/rating/selection/allow-reset/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="AllowReset.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/rating/selection/allow-reset/allowreset.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% endif %}

# Precision Modes in ASP.NET Core Rating Control

You can use the [precision](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Inputs.Rating.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Inputs_Rating_Precision) property of the ASP.NET Core Rating control to provide ratings with varying levels of precision.

The precision types of Rating are as follows:

* Full: The rating is increased in whole number increments. For example, if the current rating is 2, the next possible ratings are 3, 4, and so on.
* Half: The rating is increased in increments of 0.5 (half). For example, if the current rating is 2.5, the next possible ratings are 3, 3.5, 4, and so on. 
* Quarter: The rating is increased in increments of 0.25 (quarter). For example, if the current rating is 3.75, the next possible ratings are 4, 4.25, 4.5, and so on. 
* Exact: The rating is increased in increments of 0.1. For example, if the current rating is 3.9, the next possible ratings are 4, 4.1, 4.2, and so on.

# Accessibility

The Carousel component has been designed,  keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/) specifications, and applying the WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties along with keyboard support for people who use assistive devices. WAI-ARIA accessibility support is achieved through attributes like `aria-multiselectable`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, and `aria-hidden`. It provides information about elements in a document for assistive technology.  The component implements keyboard navigation support by following the [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) and has been tested in major screen readers.

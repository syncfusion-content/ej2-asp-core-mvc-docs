# Accessibility

The Carousel component has been designed, keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/) specifications, and applying the WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties along with keyboard support for people who use assistive devices. WAI-ARIA accessibility support is achieved through attributes like `aria-multiselectable`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, and `aria-hidden`. It provides information about elements in a document for assistive technology. The component implements keyboard navigation support by following the [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) and has been tested in major screen readers.

## ARIA attributes

The carousel component is designed by considering [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) standard. Carousel is supported with ARIA Accessibility which is accessible by on-screen readers and other assistive technology devices. The following list of attributes is added to the Carousel.

| **Roles and Attributes** | **Functionalities**                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `aria-hidden`            | For all carousel elements except the currently visible item, `aria-hidden` is set to `true`.                                                |
| `aria-live`              | For carousel items element, when autoPlay is true, `aria-live` is set to `off`; when `autoPlay` is `false`, `aria-live` is set to `polite`. |
| `aria-role`              | For carousel slide item, `aria-role` should be group.                                                                                       |

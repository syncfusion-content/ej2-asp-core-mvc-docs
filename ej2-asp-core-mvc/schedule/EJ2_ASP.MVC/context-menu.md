# Context menu

You can display context menu on work cells and appointments of Scheduler by making use of the `ContextMenu` control manually from the application end. In the following code example, context menu control is being added from sample end and set its target as `Scheduler`.

On Scheduler cells, you can display the menu items such as `New Event`, `New Recurring Event` and `Today` option.

The default event window can be opened for appointment creation and editing using the `openEditor` method of Scheduler.

# Context menu in ##Platform_Name## Schedule Component

You can display context menu on work cells and appointments of Scheduler by making use of the [`ContextMenu`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/context-menu/getting-started) control manually from the application end. In the following code example, context menu control is being added from sample end and set its target as `Scheduler`.

On Scheduler cells, you can display the menu items such as `New Event`, `New Recurring Event` and `Today` option. For appointments, you can display its related options such as `Edit Event` and `Delete Event`. The default event window can be opened for appointment creation and editing using the `openEditor` method of Scheduler.

The deletion of appointments can be done by using the `deleteEvent` public method. Also, the [`SelectedDate`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Schedule.Schedule.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Schedule_Schedule_SelectedDate) property can be used to navigate between different dates.

N> You can also display custom menu options on Scheduler cells and appointments. Context menu will open on tap-hold in responsive mode.

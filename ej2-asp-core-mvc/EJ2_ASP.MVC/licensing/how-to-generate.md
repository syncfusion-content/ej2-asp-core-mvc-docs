Syncfusion license keys are **version and platform specific**, refer to the [KB](https://www.syncfusion.com/kb/8976/how-to-generate-license-key-for-essential-studio-products) to generate the license key for the required version and platform. Also, refer this [KB](https://www.syncfusion.com/kb/8951/which-version-syncfusion-license-key-should-i-use-in-my-application) to know about which version of the Syncfusion license key should be used in the application.

## Claim License key

Syncfusion License keys can also be generated from the **"Claim License Key"** page based on the trial or valid license associated with your Syncfusion account.

You can get the license key, based on license availability in your Syncfusion account.

### Active License

If you have a Syncfusion account associated with valid license, license key will be generated from claim license key page.

### Expired License

If you have a Syncfusion account with an expired license, your license subscription must be renewed in order to obtain a valid license key for the latest Essential Studio version. Meanwhile, a temporary license key with a 5-day validity period will be generated.

### No Trial or No License or Expired trial

If the Syncfusion account is not associated with a trial, license, or expired trial, you can try to claim either a trial or a valid license from claim license page.

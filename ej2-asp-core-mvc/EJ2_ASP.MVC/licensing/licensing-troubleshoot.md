# Syncfusion Licensing FAQ

## Is an internet connection required for Syncfusion Essential Studio license validation?

* Syncfusion license validation is done offline during application execution and does not require internet access. 

* Apps registered with a Syncfusion license key can be deployed on any system that does not have an internet connection.

## How to upgrade from Trial version after purchasing a license

To upgrade from trial version, there are two possible solutions.

* Uninstall the trial version and install the fully licensed build from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website.

* If you are using Syncfusion controls from [nuget.org](https:/www.nuget.org/packages?q=syncfusion), replace the currently used trial license key with a paid license key that can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website. Refer to [this](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/licensing/how-to-register-in-an-application) topic for more information regarding registering the license in the application.

>**NOTE** <br /> License registration is not required if you reference Syncfusion assemblies from Licensed installer. These licensing changes applicable to all evaluators who refers the Syncfusion assemblies from evaluation installer and those who use Syncfusion NuGet packages form [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/)

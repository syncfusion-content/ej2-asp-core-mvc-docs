* The file explorer dialog will appear, choose the image and then add the image to the PDF page.

>The JPG and JPEG image format is only supported in the custom stamp annotations.

## Setting default properties during control initialization

The properties of the stamp annotation can be set before creating the control using the StampSettings.

After editing the default opacity using the Edit Opacity tool, they will be changed to the selected values.
Refer to the following code sample to set the default sticky note annotation settings.

```html
    <div style="width:100%;height:600px">
        @Html.EJS().PdfViewer("pdfviewer").ServiceUrl(VirtualPathUtility.ToAbsolute("~/PdfViewer/")).DocumentPath("PDF_Succinctly.pdf").StampSettings(new Syncfusion.EJ2.PdfViewer.PdfViewerStampSettings { Opacity = 0.3, Author = "Guest User" }).Render()
    </div>
```

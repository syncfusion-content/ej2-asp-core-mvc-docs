# Managing Local Storage in Syncfusion PDF Viewer

The Syncfusion PDF Viewer provides the `enableLocalStorage` property, which allows you to control how session-specific data is stored. You can choose to store this data in an internal collection or rely on the default session storage.

### Using the enableLocalStorage Property

Set the `enableLocalStorage` property to manage whether the PDF Viewer uses session storage (default) or an internal collection. When set to `true`, session-specific data is kept in memory. Otherwise, session storage is used.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Standalone" %}

@using Syncfusion.EJ2
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Home Page";
}

<div>
    <!-- Render PDF Viewer -->
    @Html.EJS().PdfViewer("pdfviewer").DocumentPath("https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/pdf/pdf-succinctly.pdf").Render()
</div>

<!-- Ensure necessary Syncfusion scripts and styles are included -->
<script src="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/ej2/28.1.33/dist/ej2.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    window.onload = function () {
        var viewer = document.getElementById('pdfviewer').ej2_instances[0];
        viewer.enableLocalStorage = true;
    }
</script>

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

### Impact and Considerations

- **Increased Memory Usage**: Setting `enableLocalStorage` to `true` can increase memory usage, particularly with larger documents or those containing many interactive elements, such as form fields and annotations.
- **Avoiding Memory Leaks**: It is crucial to properly dispose of the PDF Viewer instance when it's no longer needed to prevent memory leaks, especially when using in-memory storage.
- **Default Behavior**: By default, this property is set to `false`, meaning the session storage mechanism is utilized unless explicitly changed.

### Enhanced Control

Leveraging the `enableLocalStorage` property provides greater flexibility in managing how data is stored during a session, allowing you to optimize performance and storage based on your applicationâ€™s specific requirements.

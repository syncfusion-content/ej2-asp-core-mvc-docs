# Document Loading Issues in Version 23.1 or Newer

If you're experiencing problems with your document not rendering in the viewer, especially when using version 23.1 or a newer version, follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Check for `viewer.dataBind()` Requirement**: Ensure that you have called `viewer.dataBind()` as required in version 23.1 or newer. This explicit call is essential for initializing data binding and document rendering correctly. It is must to call the dataBind() method before load.

```html
<button id="viewer" onclick="documentLoad()">Load</button>
<div class="text-center">
    <ejs-pdfviewer id="pdfviewer" style="height:600px">
    </ejs-pdfviewer>
</div>

<script>
    function documentLoad() {
        var pdfViewer = document.getElementById('pdfviewer').ej2_instances[0];
        pdfViewer.serviceUrl = "https://ej2services.syncfusion.com/angular/development/api/pdfviewer";
        pdfViewer.dataBind();
        pdfViewer.load("https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/pdf/annotations.pdf");
    }
</script>
```

2. **Verify Document Source**: Confirm that the document source or URL you're trying to display is valid and accessible. Incorrect URLs or document paths can lead to loading issues.

3. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure that your application has a stable network connection. Document rendering may fail if the viewer can't fetch the document due to network issues.

4. **Console Errors**: Use your browser's developer tools to check for any error messages or warnings in the console. These messages can provide insights into what's causing the document not to load.

5. **Loading Sequence**: Make sure that you're calling `viewer.dataBind()` and initiating document loading in the correct sequence. The viewer should be properly initialized before attempting to load a document.

7. **Update Viewer**: Ensure that you're using the latest version of the viewer library or framework. Sometimes, issues related to document loading are resolved in newer releases.

8. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: If you're loading documents from a different domain, ensure that CORS headers are correctly configured to allow cross-origin requests.

9. **Content Security Policies (CSP)**: Check if your application's Content Security Policy allows the loading of external resources, as this can affect document loading. Refer [here](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/common/troubleshoot/content-security-policy) to troubleshoot.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to address issues related to document loading in version 23.1 or newer, ensuring that your documents render correctly in the viewer.

# Include the Authorization token

The PDF Viewer library allows you to include the authorization token in the PDF viewer AJAX request using the properties of the ajaxRequest header available in `AjaxRequestSettings`, and it will be included in every AJAX request send from PDF Viewer.

The following steps are used to include the authorization token to the PDF viewer control.

**Step 1:** Follow the steps provided in the [link](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetcore/documentation/pdfviewer/getting-started/) to create simple PDF Viewer sample in React.

**Step 2:** Add the following code snippet to include the authorization token.

```html
<script>
    // Include the Authorization token
    window.onload = function () {
        var pdfViewer = document.getElementById('pdfViewer').ej2_instances[0];
        pdfViewer.ajaxRequestSettings = {
            ajaxHeaders: [
                {
                    headerName: 'Authorization',

                    headerValue: 'Bearer 64565dfgfdsjweiuvbiuyhiueygf'
                }
            ],
            withCredentials: false
        };
    }
</script>
```

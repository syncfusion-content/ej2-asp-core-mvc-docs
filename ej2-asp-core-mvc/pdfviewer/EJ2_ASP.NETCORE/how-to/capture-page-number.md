The following steps are used to capture the current page number.

**Step 1:** Follow the steps provided in the [link](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetcore/documentation/pdfviewer/getting-started/) to create a simple PDF Viewer sample.

```html
<button onclick="currentPage()">currentpage</button>

        var viewer = document.getElementById('pdfviewer').ej2_instances[0];
        var pageNumber = viewer.currentPageNumber;
        alert("current page number is" + pageNumber);

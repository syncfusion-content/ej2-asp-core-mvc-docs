## WAI-ARIA attributes

[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/) (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript,and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components. The following ARIA attributes are used in the PDF Viewer component:

| `aria-haspopup` | Indicates whether the PDF Viewer input element has a suggestion list or not. |
| `aria-label` | Indicates the breadcrumb item text. |
| `aria-labelledby` | Provides a label for the PDF Viewer. Typically, the "aria-labelledby" attribute will contain the id of the element used as the PDF Viewer's title. |
| `aria-describedby` | This attribute points to the PDF Viewer element describing the one it's set on. |
| `aria-orientation` | Indicates whether the PDF Viewer element is oriented horizontally or vertically. |
| `aria-valuetext` | Returns the current text of the PDF Viewer. |
| `aria-valuemax` | Indicates the Maximum value of the PDF Viewer. |
| `aria-valuemin` | Indicates the Minimum value of the PDF Viewer. |
| `aria-valuenow` | Indicates the current value of the PDF Viewer. |
| `aria-controls` | Attribute is set to the button and it points to the corresponding content. |

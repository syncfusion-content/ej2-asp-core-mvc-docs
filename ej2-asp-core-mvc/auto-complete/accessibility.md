# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## AutoComplete Control

The AutoComplete control has been designed, keeping in mind the `WAI-ARIA` specifications, and applies the `WAI-ARIA` roles, states, and properties along with `keyboard support`. This control is characterized by complete keyboard interaction support and ARIA accessibility support that makes it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) or those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

## ARIA attributes

The AutoComplete control uses the `combobox` role and each list item has an `option` role. The following `ARIA Attributes` denote the AutoComplete state.

| **Property** | **Functionalities** |
| --- | --- |
| aria-haspopup | Indicates whether the AutoComplete input element has a suggestion list or not. |
| aria-expanded | Indicates whether the suggestion list has expanded or not. |
| aria-selected | Indicates the selected option from the list. |
| aria-readonly | Indicates the readonly state of the AutoComplete element. |
| aria-disabled | Indicates whether the AutoComplete control is in a disabled state or not.|
| aria-activedescendent | This attribute holds the ID of the active list item to focus its descendant child element. |
| aria-owns | This attribute contains the ID of the suggestion list to indicate popup as a child element. |
| aria-autocomplete | This attribute contains the ‘both’ to a list of options shows and the currently selected suggestion also shows inline. |

## Keyboard interaction

You can use the following key shortcuts to access the AutoComplete without interruptions.

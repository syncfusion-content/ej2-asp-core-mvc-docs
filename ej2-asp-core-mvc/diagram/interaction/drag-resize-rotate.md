# Drag Resize and Rotate

## Drag

* An object can be dragged by clicking and dragging it. When multiple elements are selected, dragging any one of the selected elements move every selected element.
* When you drag the elements in the diagram, the [`positionChange`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Diagrams.Diagram.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Diagrams_Diagram_PositionChange) event gets triggered and to do customization in this event.

## Resize

* Selector is surrounded by eight thumbs. When dragging these thumbs, selected items can be resized.
* When one corner of the selector is dragged, opposite corner is in a static position.
* When a node is resized, the [`sizeChange`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Diagrams.Diagram.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Diagrams_Diagram_SizeChange) event gets triggered.

> While dragging and resizing, the objects are snapped towards the nearest objects to make better alignments. For better alignments, refer to `Snapping`.

## Customize the resize-thumb

You can change the size of the node resize thumb and the connector end point handle by using the `handleSize` property. The appearance such as fill, stroke, and stroke width of the node resize thumb and connector end point handle can be customized by overriding the e-diagram-resize-handle and e-diagram-endpoint-handle classes respectively.

## Rotate

* A rotate handler is placed above the selector. Clicking and dragging the handler in a circular direction lead to rotate the node.
* The node is rotated with reference to the static pivot point.
* Pivot thumb (thumb at the middle of the node) appears while rotating the node to represent the static point.

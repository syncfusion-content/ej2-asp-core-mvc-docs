# Excel Like Filter in ##Platform_Name## Tree Grid Component

You can enable Excel like filter by defining.
[`Type`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.TreeGrid.TreeGridFilterSettings~Type.html) of [`FilterSettings`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.TreeGrid.TreeGridFilterSettings.html) as **Excel**.The excel menu contains an option such as Sorting, Clear filter, Sub menu for advanced filtering.

## Change default excel filter operator

You can change the default excel-filter operator by changing the column operator as `contains` from `startsWith` in the [`actionBegin`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.TreeGrid.TreeGrid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_TreeGrid_TreeGrid_ActionBegin) event.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-grid/filtering/excelfilter-default-operator/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Excelfilter-default-operator.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-grid/filtering/excelfilter-default-operator/excelfilter-default-operator.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-grid/filtering/excelfilter-default-operator/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Excelfilter-default-operator.cs" %}

> You can refer to our [`ASP.NET MVC Tree Grid`](https://www.syncfusion.com/aspnet-mvc-ui-controls/tree-grid) feature tour page for its groundbreaking feature representations. You can also explore our [`ASP.NET MVC Tree Grid example`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/TreeGrid/Overview#/material) to knows how to present and manipulate data.


> * By default, while opening the excel/checkbox filter in the TreeGrid, the filter dialog will get and display the distinct data from the first 1000 records bound to the TreeGrid to optimize performance. The remaining records will be returned as a result of the search option of the filter dialog.
> * However, we can increase the excel/checkbox filter count by modifying the `filterChoiceCount` argument value(as per our need) in the [`actionBegin`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.TreeGrid.TreeGrid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_TreeGrid_TreeGrid_ActionBegin) event when the `requestType` is `filterchoicerequest` or `filtersearchbegin`.

# Loading Animation in ASP.NET Core Tree Grid Component

The Tree Grid displays a loading indicator while the data is being fetched and bound to the tree grid during initial rendering, refreshing, and after performing any tree grid actions like sorting, filtering, and more.

The tree grid supports two indicator types, which can be enabled by setting the `loadingIndicator.indicatorType` property to Spinner or Shimmer. The default value of the indicator type is Spinner.

In the following sample, the Shimmer indicator is displayed while the tree grid is loading and refreshing when using the remote data.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-grid/data-binding-core/loading-animation/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="LoadingAnimation.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-grid/data-binding-core/loading-animation/loadingAnimation.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="LoadingAnimation.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-grid/data-binding-core/loading-animation/loadingAnimation.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

# Row Selection in ##Platform_Name## Tree Grid Component

## Toggle selection

The Toggle selection allows to perform selection and unselection of the particular row or cell. To enable toggle selection, set [`enableToggle`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.TreeGrid.TreeGridSelectionSettings~enabletoggle.html) property of the selectionSettings as true. If you click on the selected row or cell then it will be unselected and vice versa.

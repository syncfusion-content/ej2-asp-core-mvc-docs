# Immutable Mode

The immutable mode optimizes the Tree Grid re-rendering performance by using the object reference and [`deep compare`](https://dmitripavlutin.com/how-to-compare-objects-in-javascript/#4-deep-equality) concept. When performing the Tree Grid actions, it will only re-render the modified or newly added rows and prevent the re-rendering of the unchanged rows.

To enable this feature, you have to set the `enableImmutableMode` property as **true**.

>* This feature uses the primary key value for data comparison. So, you need to provide the [`isPrimaryKey`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.TreeGrid.TreeGridColumn.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_TreeGrid_TreeGridColumn_IsPrimaryKey) column.

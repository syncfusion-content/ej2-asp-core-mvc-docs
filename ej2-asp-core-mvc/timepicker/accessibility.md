# Accessibility

The web accessibility makes web applications and its content more accessible to people with disabilities without any barriers. It especially it tracks the dynamic value changes and DOM changes.

The TimePicker control has covered the [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices) specifications with the following list of WAI-ARIA attributes: `aria-haspopup`, `aria-selected`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-activedescendant`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-owns`, and `aria-autocomplete`.

Here in TimePicker, the `combobox` plays the role of input element, and the `listbox` plays the role of popup element.

* **Aria-haspopup**: Provides the information about whether this element display a pop-up window or not.

* **Aria-selected**: Indicates the current selected value of the TimePicker control.

* **Aria-disabled**: Indicates disabled state of the TimePicker control.

* **Aria-expanded**: Indicates the expanded state of the popup.

* **Aria-autocomplete**: Indicates whether user input completion suggestions are provided or not.

* **Aria-owns**: Attribute that creates a parent/child relationship between two DOM element in the accessibility layer.

* **Aria-activedescendent**: Attribute that helps in managing the current active child of the TimePicker control.

* **Role**: Attribute that gives assistive technology information for handling each element in a widget.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Textbox is characterized with complete ARIA Accessibility support that helps to access through the on-screen readers and other assistive technology devices. This component is designed with the reference of the guidelines document given in [WAI ARAI Accessibility practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#textbox).

The Textbox uses the `textbox` role and following ARIA properties for its element based on its state.

| **Property** | **Functionality** |
| --- | --- |
| aria-placeholder | The `aria-placeholder` is a short hint to help the users with data entry when the Textbox has no value. |
| aria-labelledby | The `aria-labelledby` property indicates the floating label element of the Textbox. |

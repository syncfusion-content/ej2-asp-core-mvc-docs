# Annotation in the ##Platform_Name## Image Editor control

The Image Editor allows adding annotations to the image, including text, freehand drawings, and shapes like rectangles, ellipses, arrows, paths, and lines. This gives the flexibility to mark up the image with notes, sketches, and other visual elements as needed. These annotation tools can help to communicate and share ideas more effectively. Users are allowed to draw multiple annotations simultaneously, enhancing creative flexibility. Furthermore, every action, including customizations, will be tracked in the undo/redo collection, ensuring a seamless user experience and making it easier to experiment with different designs.

## Text annotation 

The text annotation feature in the Image Editor provides the capability to add and customize labels, captions, and other text elements directly onto the image. With this feature, you can easily insert text at specific locations within the image and customize various aspects of the text to meet your requirements. 

You have control over the customization options including text content, font family, font style and font size for the text annotation. 

### Add a text 

The `drawText` method in the Image Editor allows you to insert a text annotation into the image with specific customization options. This method accepts the following parameters: 

* x: Specifies the x-coordinate of the text, determining its horizontal position within the image. 

* y: Specifies the y-coordinate of the text, determining its vertical position within the image. 

* text: Specifies the actual text content to be added to the image. 

* fontFamily: Specifies the font family of the text, allowing you to choose a specific typeface or style for the text. 

* fontSize: Specifies the font size of the text, determining its relative size within the image. 

* bold: Specifies whether the text should be displayed in bold style. Set to true for bold text, and false for regular text. 

* italic: Specifies whether the text should be displayed in italic style. Set to true for italic text, and false for regular text. 

* color: Specifies the font color of the text, allowing you to define the desired color using appropriate color values or names.

* isSelected: Specifies to show the text in the selected state.

By utilizing the DrawText method with these parameters, you can precisely position and customize text annotations within the image. This provides the flexibility to add labels, captions, or other text elements with specific font styles, sizes, and colors, enhancing the visual presentation and clarity of the image. 

Here is an example of adding a text in a button click using `drawText` method. 

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/text/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Default.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/text/default.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/text/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Default.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/text/default.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

Output be like the below.

### Multiline text 

The `drawText` method in the Image Editor control is commonly used to insert text annotations into an image. If the provided text parameter contains a newline character (\n), the text will be automatically split into multiple lines, with each line appearing on a separate line in the annotation. 

Here is an example of adding a multiline text in a button click using `drawText` method.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/multi-line-text/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Default.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/multi-line-text/default.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/multi-line-text/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Default.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/multi-line-text/default.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

Output be like the below.

### Delete a text 

The `deleteShape` method in the Image Editor control allows you to remove a text annotation from the image editor. To use this method, you need to pass the `shapeId` of the annotation as a parameter.

The `shapeId` is a unique identifier assigned to each text annotation within the image editor. It serves as a reference to a specific annotation, enabling targeted deletion of the desired text element. By specifying the `shapeId` associated with the text annotation you want to remove, you can effectively delete it from the image editor.

To retrieve the inserted text annotations, you can utilize the `getShapeSetting` method, which provides a collection of annotations represented by `ShapeSettings`. This method allows you to access and work with the annotations that have been inserted into the image.

Here is an example of deleting a text in a button click using `deleteShape` method.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/delete-text/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Default.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/delete-text/default.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/delete-text/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Default.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/delete-text/default.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

Output be like the below.

### Customize font family and text color 

The ShapeChanging event in the Image Editor control is triggered when a text annotation is being modified or changed through the toolbar interaction. This event provides an opportunity to make alterations to the text's color and font family by adjusting the relevant properties. 

By leveraging the ShapeChanging event, you can enhance the customization options for text annotations and provide a more tailored and interactive experience within the Image Editor control. 

Here is an example of changing the textâ€™s color and its font family using the ShapeChanging event.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/customize-font-color/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Default.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/customize-font-color/default.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/customize-font-color/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Default.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/customize-font-color/default.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

### Add Additional font family

The FontFamily property in the Image Editor control provides the flexibility to incorporate supplementary font families, expanding your options for text styling and ensuring a broader range of fonts can be utilized within your design or content. The font value will be determined by the 'id' property.

By leveraging the FontFamily property, you can elevate the scope of customization for text annotations, enriching the user experience within the Image Editor control. This enhancement offers a more personalized and dynamic interaction, empowering users to tailor their text styles for a truly engaging editing experience.

Here is an example of adding additional font family to the text annotation using the FontFamily property.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/image-editor/annotation/add-additional-font-family/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Default.cs" %}

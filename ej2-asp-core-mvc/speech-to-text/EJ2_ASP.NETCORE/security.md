# Security concerns and practices in ##Platform_Name## SpeechToText control

## Online Dependency

The Speech-to-text control may require an active internet connection. If an internet connection is unavailable, an offline fallback should be considered.

## Potential Security Risks

Speech recognition may transmit audio data to external servers, raising privacy concerns. Ensure that user data is processed securely.

## Mitigation Strategies & alternatives

Consider using offline speech recognition options or encrypting data during transmission to protect user privacy.

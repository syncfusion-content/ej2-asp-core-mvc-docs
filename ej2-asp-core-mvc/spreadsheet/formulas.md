# Formulas in Spreadsheet control

Formulas are used for calculating the data in a worksheet. You can refer the cell reference from same sheet or from different sheets.

## Usage

You can set formula for a cell in the following ways,

* Using the `formula` property from `cell`, you can set the formula or expression to each cell at initial load.
* Set the formula or expression through data binding.
* You can set formula for a cell by [`editing`](./editing).
* Using the `updateCell` method, you can set or update the cell formula.

## Culture-Based Argument Separator

Previously, although you could import culture-based Excel files into the Spreadsheet control, the formulas wouldn't calculate correctly. This was due to the absence of culture-based argument separators and support for culture-based formatted numeric values as arguments. However, starting from version 25.1.35, you can now import culture-based Excel files into the Spreadsheet component.

> Before importing culture-based Excel files, ensure that the Spreadsheet control is rendered with the corresponding culture. Additionally, launch the import/export services with the same culture to ensure compatibility.

When loading spreadsheet data with culture-based formula argument separators using cell data binding, local/remote data, or JSON, ensure to set the [listSeparator](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/syncfusion.ej2.spreadsheet.spreadsheet.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Spreadsheet_Spreadsheet_ListSeparator) property value as the culture-based list separator from your end. Additionally, note that when importing an Excel file, the [listSeparator](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/syncfusion.ej2.spreadsheet.spreadsheet.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Spreadsheet_Spreadsheet_ListSeparator) property will be updated based on the culture of the launched import/export service.

In the example below, the Spreadsheet control is rendered with the `German culture (de)`. Additionally, you can find references on how to set the culture-based argument separator and culture-based formatted numeric value as arguments to the formulas.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs3/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="FormulaController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs3/formulaController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs3/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="FormulaController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs3/formulaController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

## Create User Defined Functions / Custom Functions

The Spreadsheet includes a number of built-in formulas. For your convenience, a list of supported formulas can be found [here](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetcore/documentation/spreadsheet/formulas#supported-formulas).

You can define and use an unsupported formula, i.e. a user defined/custom formula, in the spreadsheet by using the `addCustomFunction` function. Meanwhile, remember that you should define a user defined/custom formula whose results should only return a single value. If a user-defined/custom formula returns an array, it will be time-consuming to update adjacent cell values.

The following code example shows an unsupported formula in the spreadsheet.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="FormulaController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula/formulaController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="FormulaController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula/formulaController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

Second, if you want to directly compute any formula or expression, you can use the `computeExpression` method. This method will work for both built-in and used-defined/custom formula.

The following code example shows how to use `computeExpression` method in the spreadsheet.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs2/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="FormulaController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs2/formulaController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs2/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="FormulaController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs2/formulaController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

## Formula bar

Formula bar is used to edit or enter cell data in much easier way. By default, the formula bar is enabled in the spreadsheet. Use the [`showFormulaBar`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Spreadsheet.Spreadsheet.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Spreadsheet_Spreadsheet_ShowFormulaBar) property to enable or disable the formula bar.

## Named Ranges

You can define a meaningful name for a cell range and use it in the formula for calculation. It makes your formula much easier to understand and maintain. You can add named ranges to the Spreadsheet in the following ways,

* Using the [`definedNames`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Spreadsheet.Spreadsheet.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Spreadsheet_Spreadsheet_DefinedNames) collection, you can add multiple named ranges at initial load.
* Use the `addDefinedName` method to add a named range dynamically.
* You can remove an added named range dynamically using the `removeDefinedName` method.
* Select the range of cells, and then enter the name for the selected range in the name box.

The following code example shows the usage of named ranges support.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/defined-names/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="DefinedNameController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/defined-names/definedNameController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/defined-names/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="DefinedNameController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/defined-names/definedNameController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

# Filtering in Spreadsheet control

Filtering helps you to view specific rows in the spreadsheet by hiding the other rows. You can use the [`allowFiltering`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Spreadsheet.Spreadsheet.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Spreadsheet_Spreadsheet_AllowFiltering) property to enable or disable filtering functionality.

N> * The default value for `allowFiltering` property is `true`.

By default, the `filter` module is injected internally into Spreadsheet to perform filtering.

## Apply filter on UI

In the active Spreadsheet, select a range of cells to filter by value of the cell. The filtering can be done by any of the following ways:

* Select the filter item in the Ribbon toolbar.
* Right-click the sheet, select the filter item in the context menu.
* Use the `applyFilter()` method programmatically.
* Use `Ctrl + Shift + L` keyboard shortcut to apply the filter.

N> * Use `Alt + Up/Down` keyboard shortcut to open the filter dialog.

## Filter by criteria

The `applyFilter()` method will apply the filter UI, based on the predicate and range given in the arguments.

N> * The `beforeFilter` event will be triggered before filtering the specified range.
<br/> * The `filterComplete` event will be triggered after the filter action is completed successfully.

The following code example shows `filter` functionality in the Spreadsheet control.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/filter/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="FilterController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/filter/filterController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/filter/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="FilterController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/filter/filterController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}



## Filter by cell value

To apply a filter for a cell value, right-click the cell and choose filter -> `Filter By Selected Cell's Value` option from the menu. It applies the filter based on the value of the selected cell in the current sheet.

## Clear filter

After applying filter to a certain column, you may want to clear it to make all filtered rows visible again. It can be done in the following ways,

* Choose `Clear` option in ribbon toolbar under `Filter and Sort`. It clears the filters applied in the spreadsheet for all fields.

* Use the `clearFilter()` method programmatically, to clear the applied filters in spreadsheet for all fields.

## Clear filter on a field

After filtering, you can clear/reset the filter for a field alone. It can be done in the following ways,

* Click filter icon in the columnâ€™s header and then choose `Clear Filter` option from the filter dialog.
* You can right-click on a filtered column cell and choose `Clear Filter from <Column Name>.` option from the context menu.
* Use the `clearFilter(field)` method programmatically, to clear the filter in a particular column.

## Reapply filter

When you want to reapply the filter after some changes happened in the rows. It can be done in the following ways,

* You can choose `Reapply` option in ribbon toolbar under `Filter and Sort` to reapply the filtered columns again.
* You can right-click on a filtered cell and choose `Reapply` option from the context menu. It reapplies the filters again in the Spreadsheet for all the fields.

## Known error validations

The following errors have been handled for filtering,
* *Out of range validation:* When the selected range is not a used range of the active sheet, it is considered as invalid and the out of range alert with the message `Select a cell or range inside the used range and try again` will be displayed. No filter will be performed if the range is invalid.

## Get data from filtered rows

Filtering allows you to view specific rows in a spreadsheet while hiding the others. The [allowFiltering](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/syncfusion.ej2.spreadsheet.spreadsheet.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Spreadsheet_Spreadsheet_AllowFiltering) property allows you to enable or disable filtering functionality through the UI. You can also use the [allowFiltering](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/syncfusion.ej2.spreadsheet.spreadsheet.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Spreadsheet_Spreadsheet_AllowFiltering) property and `applyFilter` method combination to filter data via code behind. The filtered rows can be identified by iterating through the row collection on the sheet and using the `isFiltered` property available in each row object.

The following code example shows how to get the filtered rows.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/filter-cs1/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="InsertSheetController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/filter-cs1/filterController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/filter-cs1/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="InsertSheetController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/filter-cs1/filterController.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

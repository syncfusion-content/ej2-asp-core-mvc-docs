# Undo and Redo in Spreadsheet control

`Undo` option helps you to undone the last action performed and `Redo` option helps you to do the same action which is reverted in the Spreadsheet. You can use the [`allowUndoRedo`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Spreadsheet.Spreadsheet.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Spreadsheet_Spreadsheet_AllowUndoRedo) property to enable or disable undo redo functionality in spreadsheet.

N> * The default value for `allowUndoRedo` property is `true`.

By default, the `UndoRedo` module is injected internally into Spreadsheet to perform undo redo.

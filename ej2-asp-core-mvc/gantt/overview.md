# Overview in ##Platform_Name## Gantt component

The Gantt chart is a project management tool which provides a Microsoft Project-like interface for scheduling and managing projects. Its intuitive user interface lets you visually manage tasks, task relationships, and resources in a project.

## Key Features

* Large Data Binding - To render a large number of tasks in the Gantt Chart with an effective performance. It allows users to load parent records alone on load time. Child records render on demand during expansion action.
* Editing - A task’s fields, such as duration, start date, end date, predecessors, and more, can be edited directly in their respective cells, using dialog, or interactively using taskbars.
* Undo/Redo - It enables users to revert the most recent action performed in the Gantt Chart. Redo feature can reapply an action that was previously undone using the Undo feature. This allows users to revert their decision to undo an action.
* Task Dependencies - Define task relationships using finish-to-start, start-to-finish, start-to-start, and finish-to-finish task dependency types.
* Customizable Timeline – Display timescale from minutes to decades easily, and also support to display even custom texts. Timeline can be displayed in either one-tier or two-tier layout.
* Taskbars – Supports unscheduled tasks, and it can be customized. Baselines can also be displayed for the tasks.
* Critical path - It is a series of tasks (or sometimes only a single task) that controls the calculated finish date of the project. If a task in a critical path is delayed, then the entire project will be delayed.
* Timezone - It explains the Gantt Chart schedules project in their respective timezones.
* Columns – Customize the columns and add custom columns to Gantt chart at initialization.
* Resources - Resources are represented by staff, equipment, materials, and more. We can show and allocate the resources for each task.

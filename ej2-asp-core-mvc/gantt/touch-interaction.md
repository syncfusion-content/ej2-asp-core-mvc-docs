# Touch Interaction

The Gantt control supports to perform user interactions in mobile and tablet devices. This section explains how to interact with the Gantt features in touch-enabled devices.

## Tooltip

To perform `touch and hold` action on a element, refer to [`tooltip popup`](tooltip/#tooltip).

## Context menu

To perform `long press` action on a row, [`context menu`](context-menu/#context-menu) is opened, and then tap a menu item to trigger its action.

## Sorting

To perform `tap` action on a column header, trigger [`sorting`](sorting/#sorting) operation to the selected column. A popup is displayed for multi-column sorting. To sort multiple columns, tap the popup, and then tap the desired column headers.

The following screenshot shows Gantt touch sorting,

## Column resize

When the right edge of the column header cell is `tapped`, a floating handler will be visible over the right border of the column. To [`resize`](columns/#column-resizing) the column, drag the floating handler as needed.

The following screenshot represents the Gantt column resizing in touch device.

## Editing

The Gantt control editing actions can be achieved using the double tap and tap and drag actions on a element.

The following table describes different types of editing modes available in Gantt.

|Action |Description|
|-----|-----|
|[`Cell editing`](managing-tasks/#cell-editing) | To perform `double tap` on a specific cell, initiate the cell to be in edit state.|
|[`Dialog editing`](managing-tasks/#dialog-editing) | To perform `double tap` on a specific row, initiate the edit dialog to be opened.|
|[`Taskbar editing`](managing-tasks/#taskbar-editing) | Taskbar editing action is initiated using the `tap` action on the taskbar. <br> **Parent taskbar** : Once you tap on the parent taskbar, it will be changed to editing state. Perform only dragging action on parent taskbar editing. <br> ![Alt text](images/editing-parent.PNG) <br> **Child taskbar** : Once you tap the child taskbar, it will be changed to editing state. <br> ![Alt text](images/editing-state.PNG) <br> **Dragging taskbar** : To drag a taskbar to the left or right in editing state. <br> <br> **Resizing taskbar** : To resize a taskbar, drag the left/right resize icon. <br> <br> **Progress resizing** : To change the progress, drag the progress resize icon to the left or right direction.|

### Task dependency editing

You can `tap` the left/right connector point to initiate [`task dependencies`](managing-tasks/#task-dependencies) edit mode and again tap another taskbar to establish the dependency line between two taskbars.

The following table explains the taskbar state in dependency edit mode.

|Taskbar state |Description|
|-----|-----|
|`Parent taskbar` | You cannot create dependency relationship to parent tasks. <br> ![Parent taskbar](images/parent-taskbar.PNG)|
|`Taskbar without dependency` |  If you tap a valid child taskbar, it will create `FS` type dependency line between tasks, otherwise exits from task dependency edit mode. <br> ![Valid taskbar](images/valid-taskbar.PNG)|
|`Taskbar with dependency` | If you tap the second taskbar, which has already been directly connected, it will ask to remove it. <br> ![Invalid taskbar](images/invalid-taskbar.PNG)|
|`Removing dependency` | Once you tap the taskbar with direct dependency, then confirmation dialog will be shown for removing dependency. <br> ![Confirm dialog](images/confirm-dialog.PNG)|

> In mobile device, you cannot create dependency other than `FS` by taskbar editing. By using cell/dialog editing, you can add all type of dependencies.

## Selection

When you `tap` gantt row, tapped row will be selected.

[`Single selection`](selection/#selection-mode) : To select a single row or cell, perform `single tap` on it.

[`Multiple selection`](selection/#multiple-row-selection) : To perform multiple selection, `tap` on the multiple selection popup, and then tap the desired rows or cells.

# Globalization

## Localization

The [`Localization`](../../common/localization) library allows you to localize default text content of the Gantt.
The Gantt component has static text on some features (like toolbar area text, etc.)
that can be changed to other cultures (Arabic, Deutsch, French, etc.) by defining the
[`locale`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Gantt.Gantt.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Gantt_Gantt_Locale) value and translation object.

The following list of properties and its values are used in the Gantt.

### Loading translations

To load translation object in an application use [`load`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/l10n/#load) function of [`L10n`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/l10n/) class.

The below example demonstrates the Gantt in **Deutsch** culture.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global/locale/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Locale.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global/locale/locale.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global/locale/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Locale.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global/locale/locale.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}



## Internationalization

The [`Internationalization`](../../common/internationalization) library is used to globalize number, date, and time values in gantt component.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global/internationalization/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Internationalization.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global/internationalization/internationalization.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global/internationalization/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Internationalization.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global/internationalization/internationalization.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}



> * In the above sample, `Timeline` is formatted by `NumberFormatOptions` and `DateFormatOptions`.
> * By default, [`locale`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Gantt.Gantt.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Gantt_Gantt_Locale) value is `en-US`. If you want to change `en-US` culture, then set the [`locale`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Gantt.Gantt.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Gantt_Gantt_Locale).

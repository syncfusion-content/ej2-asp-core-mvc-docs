# Overview

The Sparkline is a very small chart; it is drawn without axes or coordinates. This presents a common shape of data in a simple and highly condensed way. The sparklines are easy to interpret, and convey more information to users by visualizing data in a small amount of space.

## Key features

* Consumes less amount of space for visualizing data.
* Supports integration with grids.
* Supports five types of sparklines: line, column, area, win-loss, and pie.
* Supports range bands to highlight the selected start and end value regions.
* Supports markers for high, low, start, end, and negative points.
* Supports trackball to get current mouse point to display tooltip.

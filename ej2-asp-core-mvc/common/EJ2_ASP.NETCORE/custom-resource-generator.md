# Custom Resource Generator for Syncfusion ASP.NET Core

Syncfusion provides an option to generate a selective controls script (JavaScript ES5) and styles by using the [Custom Resource Generator](https://crg.syncfusion.com/) (CRG) web tool for ASP.NET Core controls from v18.1.0.42.

## Search and select the control list

Search and select the required Syncfusion controls from the CRG to generate specific set of control resources.

The Syncfusion ASP.NET Core UI controls can be categorized based on the below characteristics.

* Injectable module supported controls
* Injectable module non-supported controls

`Injectable module supported controls` are rendered as treeview with checkbox format and the `Injectable module non-supported controls` are rendered as normal checkbox format in the CRG application.

Refer to the following steps to search and select the controls in CRG.

1. Open [Syncfusion Custom Resource Generator](https://crg.syncfusion.com/) (CRG) application.
2.	Type the required control name in the search bar and select the check box. The dependency of the selected control is resolved in the application itself, so it does not need to choose each dependent control by manually.

4. The final output contains the script and styles for the selected controls and a **import.json** file, which stores the current settings.
> You can use theme files in the **customized** folder if you don't want google fonts references. For now, Material and tailwind themes only generate like below.

3. Run the application and it will load the resources with application required controls.

## Import previously generated settings into the CRG

To add more controls or upgrade the latest Syncfusion ASP.NET Core library resources, it is not necessary to generate it from the scratch in the CRG. Just import the old **import.json** file and make the changes, then download it again from the CRG application.

Refer to the following steps to import previous **import.json** file in the CRG.

1.	Click the **IMPORT SETTINGS** button at the bottom of the page.

## Syncfusion Version Information

In a year, Syncfusion releases new volumes once every three months. Syncfusion ASP.NET Core controls follows sequence-based identifiers to process software releases based on the **Major.Minor.Build.Revision** format to track all the release changes. It helps developers to keep track of the changes in every release. 

For example, if the release a package version is `19.3.0.43`, the version number indicates the details as follows,

* **19** denotes `Major release` version which changes every year.
* **3** denotes `Volume release`. Syncfusion releases a new volume once every three months. Here `3` represents the third release of the year.
* **0** denotes `Build Number` and it will always zero for ASP.NET Core.
* **43** denotes `Patch Number` also known as revision number which increases for each service pack release and weekly patch release.

# Accessibility support with ADA compliance in Syncfusion ASP.NET Core controls

All the Syncfusion ASP.NET Core controls follow the WAI-ARIA accessibility standard by default. This enables you to build accessible web applications, which are fully navigable by users with disabilities.

## Section 508

Section 508 is part of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act of 1973 introduced in 1998, requires Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to people with disabilities. This law defines the need for both members of the public and Federal employees in all Federal agencies to have access to, develop, maintain, procure, or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508, Federal agencies must develop a website that can be used by people with disabilities.

> All our Syncfusion ASP.NET Core controls comply with the standard of Section 508 accessibility by default. This enables you to build accessible web applications, which are fully navigable by users with disabilities.

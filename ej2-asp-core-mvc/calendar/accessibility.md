# Accessibility in Calendar Control

The web accessibility makes web content and web applications more accessible for disabled people. It especially helps in dynamic content change and development of advanced user interface controls with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

Calendar provides built-in compliance with [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) specifications. WAI-ARIA support is achieved through attributes like `aria-label`, `aria-selected`, `aria-disabled`, and `aria-activedescendant` applied for navigation buttons, and disable and active day cells.

It helps disabled persons by providing information about the widget for assistive technology in the screen readers. Calendar control contains grid role and grid cell for each day cell.

* **Aria-label**: This attribute provides text labels for an object for the previous and next month's elements. It helps the screen reader object to read.

* **Aria-selected**: Indicates the currently selected date of the Calendar control.

* **Aria-disabled**: Indicates the disabled state of the Calendar control.

* **Aria-activedescendent**: Helps in managing the current active child of the Calendar control.

* **Role**: Gives information to assistive technologies about how to handle each element in a widget.

* **Grid-cell**: Defines the individual cell that can be focussed and selected.

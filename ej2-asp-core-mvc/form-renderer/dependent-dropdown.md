# Dependent Dropdowns in ##Platform_Name## Form Renderer component

A dependent dropdown (also called a cascading dropdown) is a group of dropdowns in which the options available in one dropdown depend on the value selected in another. Common examples include Continent → Country → State, Product Category → Subcategory, and Vehicle Make → Model → Trim.

In the Form Renderer, dependent dropdowns are configured through the `choiceBasedField` condition in a field's `conditions` object of Form schema.

## JSON Schema structure for Dependent Dropdowns

`choiceBasedField` is a condition that you can add to dropdown list field's `conditions` object. It tells the renderer that this field's options should be filtered based on the value of another field. The condition links a child dropdown to a parent field and declares a `choiceMapping` that says which child options should be visible for each parent value.

The schema below renders three linked dropdowns — Continent, Country, and State / Province. Picking a continent narrows the list of countries, and picking a country then narrows the list of states / provinces:

| Member | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `primaryFieldId` | `string` | The `id` of the parent field whose value drives the filtering. |
| `choiceMapping` | `Record<string, string[]>` | A map of parent value → child options. When the parent field's value is a key in this map, only the listed options are shown in the child dropdown. |
| `showAllWhenNotMapped` | `boolean` | Controls the behavior when the parent has no value or its value is not a key in `choiceMapping`. When `true`, the child shows every option declared in its own `options` array. When `false`, the child shows no options. |

> `primaryFieldId` references the parent's `id`, not the parent's `name`. This keeps the link robust against renames of the parent's programmatic name.

## Cascading across more than two levels

`choiceBasedField` only links two fields at a time, but you can chain it to build deeper cascades. Each level in the chain has its own `choiceBasedField` whose `primaryFieldId` points to the immediately-preceding level.

The schema above is a three-level example: Continent → Country → State / Province. The same pattern extends to four or more levels — for example, Continent → Country → State → City — by repeating the same `conditions` shape on each subsequent field.

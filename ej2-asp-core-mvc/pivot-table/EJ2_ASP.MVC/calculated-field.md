# Calculated Field in ##Platform_Name## Pivot Table Component

Allows end user to create a new calculated field in the pivot table, based on available fields from the bound data source or using simple formula with basic arithmetic operators. It can be added at runtime through the built-in dialog, invoked from Field List UI. To do so, set the [`AllowCalculatedField`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.PivotView.PivotView.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_PivotView_PivotView_AllowCalculatedField) property in [`PivotView`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.PivotView.PivotView.html) class to **true** in the pivot table. End user can now see a "CALCULATED FIELD" button enabled in Field List UI automatically, which on clicking will invoke the calculated field dialog and perform necessary operation.

Calculated field can also be included in the pivot table through code behind using the [`PivotViewCalculatedFieldsSettings`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.PivotView.PivotViewCalculatedFieldSetting.html) class. The required properties to create a new calculate field are:
* [`Name`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.PivotView.PivotViewCalculatedFieldSetting.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_PivotView_PivotViewCalculatedFieldSetting_Name): It allows to indicate the calculated field with a unique name.
* [`Formula`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.PivotView.PivotViewCalculatedFieldSetting.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_PivotView_PivotViewCalculatedFieldSetting_Formula): It allows to set the formula.
* [`Format`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.PivotView.PivotViewFormatSetting.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_PivotView_PivotViewFormatSetting_Format):  It helps to set the number format for the resultant value.

N> The calculated field is applicable only for value fields. By default, the calculated fields created through code-behind are only added to the field list and calculated field dialog UI. To display the calculated field in the pivot table UI, it must be added to the [`Values`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.PivotView.PivotViewDataSourceSettings.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_PivotView_PivotViewDataSourceSettings_Values) property, as shown in the code below.

## Editing through the field list and the grouping bar

User can also modify the existing calculated field using the built-in edit option available directly in the field list (or) grouping bar. To do so, click the "Edit" icon available in the calculated field button. Now the calculated field dialog is opened and the current calculated field name, formula and format can be changed at runtime.

## Apply the format to the calculated field values

Values in a new or existing calculated field can be formatted via the calculated field UI or code behind. The [`FormatSettings`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.PivotView.PivotViewFormatSettings.html) property in code-behind can be used to specify the desired format. For more information about the supported formats refer [`refer here`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/pivot-table/number-formatting/).

To apply format to calculated field values at runtime via UI, a built-in dropdown under the "Format" label is available, from which the user can select the pre-defined format options listed below.

* **Standard** - Denotes the numeric type.
* **Currency** - Denotes the currency type.
* **Percent** - Denotes the percentage type.
* **Custom** - Denotes the custom format. For example: "C2". This shows the value "9584.3" as "$9584.30."
* **None** - Denotes that no format will be applied.

N> By default, **None** will be selected from the dropdown.

### CalculatedFieldCreate

The event [`CalculatedFieldCreate`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.PivotView.PivotView.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_PivotView_PivotView_CalculatedFieldCreate) fires while closing the dialog on "OK" button click. It allows to customize the new or existing calculated field information obtained from the dialog. It has the following parameters

* `calculatedField`: It holds the new or existing calculated field information obtained from dialog.

* [`calculatedFieldSettings`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.PivotView.PivotViewCalculatedFieldSetting.html): It holds the [`calculatedFieldSettings`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.PivotView.PivotViewCalculatedFieldSetting.html) property of the pivot report.

* `cancel`: It is a boolean property and by setting this to true , the customization done in calculated field dialog won’t be applied to calculated field.

In the below sample, creating a calculated field without setting the format is restricted.

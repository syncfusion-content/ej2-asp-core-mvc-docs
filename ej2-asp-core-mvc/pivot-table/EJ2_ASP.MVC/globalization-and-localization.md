# Globalization and localization in ASP.NET MVC Pivot Table

The Pivot Table helps users view and interact with data in their own language and regional format. This means users from different countries can easily read and understand the data because dates, numbers, and words are shown in a way that feels familiar to them.

Globalization combines two important aspects:

**Internationalization**: This enables the Pivot Table to display dates and numbers based on local standards. For example, the date can appear as MM/dd/yyyy in the United States or dd/MM/yyyy in the United Kingdom.

**Localization**: This allows you to provide translations for text in the Pivot Table, such as button labels, menu items, and messages. You can display all these text elements in the language preferred by your users.

With both internationalization and localization, you can make sure the Pivot Table is friendly and easy to use for people who speak different languages and come from various regions.

For more details:
- Learn about [`Internationalization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/common/internationalization) for formatting dates and numbers.
- Read about [`Localization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/common/localization) for translating text content.

## Load CLDR-Data to the application

* Install the `CLDR-Data` package by using the below command (it installs the CLDR JSON data). For more information about CLDR-Data, refer to this [link](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/cldr-json-bindings).

```
npm install cldr-data --save
```

Once the package installed, you can find the culture specific JSON data under the location `/scripts/cldr-data`.

* Now use the [`loadCultureFiles`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/common/internationalization#loading-culture-data) method to load the culture specific CLDR JSON data.

In ASP.NET MVC refer the culture files directly from `/scripts/cldr-data` location. In ASP.NET Core refer the culture files directly from `/wwwroot/scripts/cldr-data` location as like the below code examples for both ASP.NET Core and MVC

```sh
    function loadCultureFiles(de) {
        var files = ['ca-gregorian.json', 'numbers.json', 'timeZoneNames.json'];
        var loader = ej.base.loadCldr;
        var loadCulture = function (prop) {
            var val, ajax;
            <!--For ASP.NET MVC -->
            ajax = new ej.base.Ajax(location.origin + '/../scripts/cldr-data/main/' + name + '/' + files[prop], 'GET', false);
            <!--For ASP.NET Core-->
            ajax = new ej.base.Ajax(location.origin + '/../wwwroot/scripts/cldr-data/main/' + name + '/' + files[prop], 'GET', false);
            ajax.onSuccess = function (value) {
                val = value;
            };
            ajax.send();
            loader(JSON.parse(val));
        };
        for (var prop = 0; prop < files.length; prop++) {
            loadCulture(prop);
        }
    }

```

* Before changing to a culture other than `English`, ensure that locale text for the concerned culture is loaded through `load` method of `L10n` class.

```sh
      var L10n = ej.base.L10n;
       L10n.load({
            "de": {
                'pivotview': {
                    'grandTotal': 'Gesamtsumme',
                    'total': 'Insgesamt',
                    'value': 'Wert',
                    'noValue': 'Kein Wert',
                    'row': 'Zeile',
                    'column': 'Spalte',
                    'collapse': 'Zusammenbruch',
                    'expand': 'Erweitern',
                },
            }
        });
```

* Set the culture by using the `locale` property.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/internationalization/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Internationalization.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/internationalization/Internationalization.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/internationalization/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Internationalization.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/internationalization/Internationalization.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}



N> * In the above sample, `Amount` field is formatted by [`NumberFormatOptions`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/common/internationalization#manipulating-numbers). For date formats, the value strings are formatted by [`DateFormatOptions`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/common/internationalization#manipulating-datetime).
* By default, `locale` value is `en-US`. If you want to change the `en-US` culture to a different culture, you have to change the `locale` accordingly.
* You can find more details about supported format strings for number formats and date formats [`here`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/common/internationalization#supported-format-string).

### Decimal separators

The Pivot Table automatically adjusts decimal separators in numeric values to match your selected culture, making data easier to read for users from different regions. As part of internationalization, you can set the culture by calling the [`setCulture`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/common/internationalization#changing-global-culture-and-currency-code) method with the appropriate culture string as its parameter. Once applied, all numeric values in the Pivot Table will display using the decimal separator convention of that culture.

For example, while English cultures typically use a dot (.) as the decimal separator, German culture uses a comma (,) instead.

The following example shows how decimal separators appear when using the `Deutsch` culture.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/locale/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Locale.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/locale/Locale.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/locale/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Locale.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/locale/Locale.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

## Localization

The [`Localization`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/common/localization) option allows you to translate the default text content of the Pivot Table into different languages. This makes the component more accessible to users from various regions by displaying text in their preferred language.

The Pivot Table contains static text elements such as drop area messages, field list titles, and other interface labels that can be translated to different cultures (Arabic, German, French, etc.). You can achieve this by setting the `locale` property and providing the appropriate translation object.

The following table shows the locale keywords and their corresponding default text values used in the Pivot Table:

### Loading Translations

To load translation content in your application, use the `load` method of the [`L10n`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/api-l10n.html) class. This method accepts translation objects that contain text content in different languages.

The following example demonstrates the Pivot Table in `Deutsch` culture.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/localization/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Localization.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/localization/Localization.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/localization/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Localization.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/localization/Localization.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}



## Right-to-left (RTL)

Right-to-left (RTL) support makes the Pivot Table more accessible and user-friendly for people who read and write in right-to-left languages such as Arabic, Farsi, and Urdu. This feature adjusts the text direction and layout of the entire Pivot Table from a left-to-right to a right-to-left orientation. To enable RTL in the Pivot Table, set the `enableRtl` property to **true**.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/rtl/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="RTL.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/rtl/RTL.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/rtl/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="RTL.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-table/globalization/rtl/RTL.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

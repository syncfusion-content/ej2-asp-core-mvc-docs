Using `navigationPaneSettings` minimum and maximum width of the navigation pane can be changed. The navigation pane can be shown or hidden using the `visible` option in the `navigationPaneSettings`.

* [Large Icons View](#large-icons-view)
* [Details View](#details-view)

This file list comprises of several columns of information about the files such as **Name**, **Date Modified**, **Type**, and **Size**. Each file has its own small icon representing the file type. Additional columns can be added using `detailsViewSettings` API. The details view allows you to perform sorting using column header.

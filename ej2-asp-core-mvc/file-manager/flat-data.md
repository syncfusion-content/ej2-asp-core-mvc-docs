# Rendering Flat Data in the File Manager Component

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

The File Manager uses a flat data JSON as an array of objects for rendering, eliminating the need to define [ajaxSettings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.FileManager.FileManager.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_FileManager_FileManager_AjaxSettings) url. To load a folder data as an array of objects, use the File Manager component's [FileSystemData](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.FileManager.FileManager.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_FileManager_FileManager_FileSystemData) object. This means you no longer need to use a separate service provider, as you can integrate services like Google, Amazon, Azure, and others directly into your code using the FileManager's action events.

## Local data

The FileManager can be populated with local data that contains the array of [FileSystemData](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.FileManager.FileManager.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_FileManager_FileManager_FileSystemData) objects with `parentId` mapping.

To render the root-level folder, specify the `parentId` as null, or there is no need to specify the `parentId` in the array of `FileSystemData` objects.

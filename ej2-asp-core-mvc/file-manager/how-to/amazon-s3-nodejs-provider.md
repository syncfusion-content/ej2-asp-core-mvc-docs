# Implement Amazon S3 custom provider in ##Platform_Name## File Manager

This guide explains how to use Amazon S3 Storage to supply the necessary data for the File Manager. Node.js fetches the required data from Amazon S3 Storage and serves it to the File Manager.

Node.js acts as the bridge between the File Manager component and Amazon S3 Storage, allowing seamless communication and data retrieval. Through this integration, the File Manager can access and interact with the data stored in Amazon S3 Storage, enabling smooth file management operations.


## Prerequisites

* Valid Amazon S3 account. ( accessKeyId, secretAccessKey, region, bucketName)
* Node version 14 above.

## Introduction to Amazon S3 Storage

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It is designed to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, and big data analytics.

To learn more about Amazon S3 buckets, refer to the AWS documentation on [Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-buckets-s3.html)

### Key concepts of Amazon S3 Storage

**Buckets:** In Amazon S3, data is organized into buckets. Buckets are the fundamental containers for data storage. Each bucket must have a globally unique name and is created in a specific Amazon Web Services (AWS) region. Think of them as top-level directories that help organize the data.

**Objects:** Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Each object consists of data, a key (name), and metadata. Objects can be any file type, such as images, videos, documents, backups, logs, and more.

**Keys:** Keys are unique identifiers for objects within a bucket. The combination of bucket, key, and version ID uniquely identifies each object.

**Regions:** AWS Regions are geographic locations around the world where AWS hosts its data centers. When you create a bucket, you specify the region where it will be stored.

By understanding the fundamental concepts and use cases of Amazon S3 Storage, you will be well-prepared to proceed with setting up and interacting with it using Node.js in the custom File Provider.


## Create Node.js project

Follow these steps to create the Node.js project.

Create a new directory for your project and run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a package.json file.

```ts

 npm init

 ```

Install the following packages.
  - express
  - @aws-sdk/client-s3
  - archiver
  - body-parser
  - cors
  - multer

```ts

npm install express @aws-sdk/client-s3 archiver body-parser cors multer

```

Open your text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) and create the index.js file, then start writing your Node.js code. This file serves as the entry point of your application.

```ts

const express = require('express'); 
const app = express(); 
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => { 
  res.send('Hello, NodeJS!'); 
});

app.listen(port, () => { 
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
  });

```

To start your Node.js application, simply run the following command in your terminal, pointing to the entry point file:

```ts

node index.js

```

## Initialize S3 client

First, initialize the S3Client. Using the AWS credentials and region, create the S3Client instance. Define the credentials and bucket details, typically from environment variables, then format the configuration as shown below.

```ts

const region = process.env.AWS_REGION;
const bucketName = process.env.AWS_BUCKET_NAME;
const accessKeyId = process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID;
const secretAccessKey = process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY;

const s3Config = {
  region: region,
  bucket: bucketName,
  accessKeyId: accessKeyId,
  secretAccessKey: secretAccessKey
};

```

Obtain the S3Client using this configuration. The **bucketName** is the bucket from your Amazon S3 account that you need to access.

```ts

const { S3Client } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');

const s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: s3Config.region,
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: s3Config.accessKeyId,
    secretAccessKey: s3Config.secretAccessKey
  }
});

```

## File actions

You need to provide the following actions: creating a new folder, copying and moving files or folders, deleting, uploading, and downloading files or folders in the file system.

### Read

Specify the directory name that needs to be accessed.

```ts

const directoryName = 'Files';

```

Create the **app.post** method with URL **'/'**.

To identify the action by use this condition **req.body.action === 'read'**

The following table represents the request parameters of **read** operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|
|action|String|read|Name of the file operation.|
|path|String|-|Relative path from which the data has to be read.|

|data|[FileManagerDirectoryContent](#file-manager-directory-content)|-|Details about the current path (directory).|


*Example for request:*

```ts
{
    action: "read",
    path: "/Videos/",
    showHiddenItems: false,
    data: [
      {
        name:"Videos",
        size:0,
        dateModified:"2023-09-14T14:28:27.000Z",
        dateCreated: "2023-09-14T11:16:57.000Z",
        hasChild:true,
        isFile:false,
        type:"Directory",
        filterPath:"/",
        _fm_icon: "e-fe-folder",

        _fm_id: "fe_tree_0",
        _fm_modified: "September 14, 2023 19:58"
      }
    ]
}
```

The following table represents the response parameters of **read** operations.

*Example for response:*

```ts
{
    cwd:
    {
        filterPath: "/",
        hasChild: true,
        name: "Videos",
        size: 0,
        type: "File Folder"
    },
    files:[
        {
            dateCreated: "2023-09-14T11:16:57.000Z",
            dateModified: "2023-09-14T11:16:57.000Z",
            filterPath: "/Videos/",
            hasChild: false,
            isFile: true,
            name: "about.txt",
            size: 29,
            type: ".txt"
        }
    ],
    error: null
}
```

Use the **ListObjectsV2Command** to list all objects with the specified prefix. Set the **Delimiter** parameter to '/' to simulate folder structure. Iterate through the response's **CommonPrefixes** for folders and **Contents** for files. Use the **HeadObjectCommand** to check if a folder has children and the **LastModified** property for `dateModified`.

> **Note:** Throughout this guide, every operation that returns a file or folder entry (Read, Create, Rename, Delete, Details, Search, Copy, and Move) must populate the `dateCreated` field. AWS S3 does not expose a separate creation date, so use the `LastModified` value from **HeadObjectCommand** (or `item.LastModified` from **ListObjectsV2Command**) for both `dateCreated` and `dateModified`. Do not reference non-existent properties such as `properties.createdOn`; otherwise, the JSON response will contain `undefined` values.

### Get image

Create the **app.get** method with URL **'/GetImage'**.

The following table represents the request parameters of **GetImage** operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|
|path|String|-|Relative path to the image file|

The req.query.path contains the exact path of the images. For example: "/Jack.png".

Download the object (image) from Amazon S3 Storage using the **GetObjectCommand** and store the result in the response variable.

Handle the exception if the image is not available in the given path. The response streams the image content directly to the client with the appropriate content type.

### Download

Create the **app.post** method with URL **'/Download'**.

The following table represents the request parameters of *download* operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|
|action|String|download|Name of the file operation|
|path|String|-|Relative path to location where the files to download are present.|
|names|String[]|-|Name list of the items to be downloaded.|
|data|[FileManagerDirectoryContent](#file-manager-directory-content)|-|Details of the download item.|

*Example for request:*

```ts

{
  action: 'download',
  path: '/Downloads/Testing/',
  names: [ 'About.txt' ],
  data: [
    {
      name: 'About.txt',
      type: '.txt',
      isFile: true,
      size: 29,
      dateModified: '2023-09-14T06:03:52.000Z',
      hasChild: false,
      filterPath: '/Downloads/Testing/',      
      _fm_created: null,
      _fm_modified: 'September 14, 2023 11:33',
      _fm_iconClass: 'e-fe-txt',
      _fm_icon: 'e-fe-txt'
    }
  ]
}

```

Parse the **req.body** to get the **downloadObj**. Download the object from Amazon S3 Storage using the **GetObjectCommand** and pipe the **response.Body** stream to the response object.

Create the archive file to download multiple files, multiple folders, and single folders, then pipe the archive to the response. The response streams the file, or a ZIP archive for multiple items, directly to the client as a binary attachment.

### Upload

Create the **app.post** method with URL **/Upload**.

The following table represents the request parameters of *Upload* operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|
|action|String|save|Name of the file operation.|
|path|String|-|Relative path to the location where the file has to be uploaded.|
|uploadFiles|`IList<IFormFile>`|-|File that are uploaded.|

*Example for request:*
```ts

{
  path: '/Pictures/',
  action: 'save',
  data: [
    {
      name: 'Pictures',
      type: 'File Folder',
      isFile: true,
      size: 0,
      dateModified: '2023-09-14T06:03:52.000Z',
      hasChild: true,
      filterPath: '',
      _fm_id: 'fe_tree_1',
    }
  ],
  filename: 'bird (2).jpg'
}

```

Multer is a middleware used to handle file uploads in Express-based web applications. Import Multer and create the Multer config to store the upload files in a buffer.

```ts

const multer = require('multer');

const multerConfig = {
  storage: multer.memoryStorage()
};

```

You need to handle the following three cases:
  - Save
  - Keep Both (action name will be **keepboth**)
  - Replace (action name will be **replace**)


Create the **PutObjectCommand** with the **req.body.filename**. If the object does not exist, then upload the data to that object. If the object already exists, then create an error message containing "File Already Exists" and send the response.

> **Note:** All upload responses (save, keepboth, and replace) must be returned as JSON with the documented structure (`{ error, files, cwd, details }`) and a `Content-Type: application/json` header. Do not return plain text such as `res.send('Success')`, otherwise the File Manager client cannot parse the response. For the duplicate-file error path, include the existing file's metadata in the `files` array so the File Manager can show the conflict in the UI.

### Create a new folder

The following table represents the request parameters of *create* operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|
|action|String|create|Name of the file operation.|
|path|String|-|Relative path in which the folder has to be created.|
|name|String|-|Name of the folder to be created.|
|data|[FileManagerDirectoryContent](#file-manager-directory-content)|-|Details about the current path (directory).|

*Example for request:*

```ts

   action: "create",
    data: [
        {
            filterPath: "/",
            hasChild: true,
            isFile: false,
            name: "files",
            nodeId: "fe_tree",
            size: 0,
            type: ""
        }
    ],
    name: "Hello",
    path: "/test/"

```

Check the existence of the folder using **HeadObjectCommand**, If the folder exists then send the error message containing "Folder already exists". If it does not exist, then create the folder. Create the folder by creating an empty object (zero-byte object) with the folder's path as the key.

The following table represents the response parameters of *create* operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|
|files|FileManagerDirectoryContent[]|-|Details of the created folder|
|error|[ErrorDetails](../file-operations.md#delete)|-|Error Details|

*Example for response:*

```ts
{
    cwd: null,
    files: [
        {
            dateCreated: "2023-09-14T10:52:25.000Z",
            dateModified: "2023-09-14T10:52:25.000Z",
            filterPath: null,
            hasChild: false,
            isFile: false,
            name: "New",
            size: 0,
            type: "Directory"
        }
    ],
    details: null,
    error: null
}
```

### Rename

The following table represents the request parameters of *rename* operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|
|action|String|rename|Name of the file operation.|
|path|String|-|Relative path in which the item is located.|
|name|String|-|Current name of the item to be renamed.|
|newName|String|-|New name for the item.|
|data|[FileManagerDirectoryContent](#file-manager-directory-content)|-|Details of the item to be renamed.|

*Example for request:*

```ts
{
    action: "rename",
    data: [
        {
            dateCreated: "2023-09-14T10:41:17.000Z",
            filterPath: "/Pictures/Nature/",
            hasChild: false,
            iconClass: "e-fe-image",
            isFile: true,
            name: "seaviews.jpg",
            size: 95866,
            type: ".jpg"
        }
    ],
    newName: "seaview.jpg",
    name: "seaviews.jpg",
    path: "/Pictures/Nature/"
}
```

Renaming can be done by copying the folder or file from the source object to target object using **CopyObjectCommand**. If the file exists at the target location, then send the error message as response.

When constructing the source and target S3 keys for a file rename, ensure the path ends with a trailing slash before appending the file name; otherwise, the S3 key is malformed and the operation silently fails. For example:

```ts
const basePath = directoryName + req.body.path;
const formattedPath = basePath.endsWith('/') ? basePath : basePath + '/';
const sourceKey = formattedPath + req.body.name;
const targetKey = formattedPath + req.body.newName;
```

To verify the existence of the target folder when renaming a folder, use a direct array length check on the result of `getAllFilesInDirectory(targetPrefix)` instead of `for await...of`; S3 list commands return a `Promise<Array>`, which is not an async iterates.

The following table represents the response parameters of *rename* operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|
|files|FileManagerDirectoryContent[]|-|Details of the renamed item.|
|error|[ErrorDetails](../file-operations.md#delete)|-|Error Details|

*Example for response:*

```ts
{
    cwd:null,
    files:[
        {
            name:"seaview.jpg",
            size:95866,
            dateModified:"2023-09-14T11:16:57.000Z",
            dateCreated:"2023-09-14T10:41:17.000Z",
            hasChild:false,
            isFile:true,
            type:".jpg",
            filterPath:"/Pictures/Nature/"
        }

    names: ["bird.jpg"],
    data: [
       {
          dateModified: "2023-09-14T09:12:53.000Z",
          filterPath: "/",

          size: 102182,
          type: ".jpg"
        }
    ]
}
```

To delete a file, use the **DeleteObjectCommand**. To delete a folder, list all objects inside that folder using **ListObjectsV2Command**, and then delete all those objects.
Handle the null exception if the file or folder is not available.

The following table represents the response parameters of *delete* operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|

        }
    ]
}
```



### Details

The following table represents the request parameters of *details* operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|

        size: 102182,
        type: ".jpg"
      }
    ]
}
```

To get the file and folder details, iterate the **req.body.names** to get the details of files and folders. If the data is file, then get the object properties using the **HeadObjectCommand**. If the data is Folder, then get the object details under that folder using **ListObjectsV2Command**. Get the required properties and send final response. Handled the null exception if the file or folder is not available.

> **Note:** When multiple files are selected, ensure the `created` and `modified` fields are always populated for each item in the loop, and track the `location` across iterations. If the selected files are in different folders, set `location` to `null` instead of overwriting it with the last item's path.

The following table represents the response parameters of *details* operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|

The following table represents the request parameters of *copy* operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|
|action|String|copy|Name of the file operation.|
|path|String|-|Relative path to the directory where the files should be copied.|
|names|String[] |-|List of files to be copied.|
|targetPath|String|-|Relative path where the items to be pasted are located.|
|data|[FileManagerDirectoryContent](#file-manager-directory-content)|-|Details of the copied item.|
|targetData|[FileManagerDirectoryContent](#file-manager-directory-content)|-|Details of the copied item.|
|renameFiles|String[]|-|Details of the renamed item.|

*Example for request:*

```ts
{
    action: "copy",
    path: "/",
    names: ["bird.jpg"],
    renameFiles: [],
    targetPath: "/asia/",
    targetData: {
      filterPath: "/",
      hasChild: true,
      name: "asia",
      size: 0,
      type: "File Folder",
      _fm_id: "fe_tree_1",
    },
    data: [
      {
        dateCreated: "2023-09-15T06:04:12.000Z",
        dateModified: "2023-09-15T06:04:12.000Z",
        filterPath: "/",
        hasChild: false,
        isFile: true,
        name: "bird.jpg",

        _fm_modified: "September 15, 2023 11:34",
      }
    ]
}
```

Action name will be **move** for move action. 

The following table represents the response parameters of *copy* operations.

|Parameter|Type|Default|Explanation|
|----|----|----|----|
|cwd|[FileManagerDirectoryContent](#file-manager-directory-content)|-|Path (Current Working Directory) details.|
|files|FileManagerDirectoryContent[]|-|Details of copied files or folders|
|error|[ErrorDetails](../file-operations.md#delete)|-|Error Details|

*Example for response:*

```ts
{
    cwd:null,
    files:[
      {
        dateCreated: "2023-09-15T06:55:03.000Z",
        dateModified: "2023-09-15T06:55:03.000Z",
        filterPath: "/asia/",
        hasChild: false,
        isFile: true,
        name: "bird.jpg",
        size: 102182,
        type: ".jpg"
      }
    ],
    error:null,
    details:null
}
```

You need to handle the following two cases:
  - Directory copy and move.
  - File copy and move.

Create the **isRename** variable to store whether the request is a rename operation. If **isRename** is false, check whether the target folder exists, and if it exists, send the error message. If **isRename** is true, skip the existence check for the folder.

To move or copy the folders you need to get all the objects from that folder using **ListObjectsV2Command** and create the new path for each object and copy the data from the old path to the new path using **CopyObjectCommand**. To move or copy the files copy the data from the source object to target object using **CopyObjectCommand**. If the action is move then delete the old object using **DeleteObjectCommand**.

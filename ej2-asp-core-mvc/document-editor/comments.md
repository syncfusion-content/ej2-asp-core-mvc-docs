# Comments in Document Editor Component

Document editor allows to add comments to documents. You can add, navigate and remove comments in code and from the UI.

## Add a new comment

Comments can be inserted to the selected text.

```typescript
documentEditor.editor.insertComment('Test comment');
```

## Add a New Comment with Date, Author, and Status

Comments can be inserted into the selected text with a specified date, author, and status.

```typescript
// In this example, a comment with the text "Nancy Davolio" is added by the author Rachel Green on July 23, 2024, at 2:30 PM. The isResolved status is set to false.

// Create a specific date: July 23, 2024, at 2:30:00 PM.
let specificDate = new Date(2024, 6, 23, 14, 30, 0); // Note: July is represented by 6 (0-based index).

// Define the properties of the comment including author, date, and resolution status.
let commentProperties = { 
    author: 'Nancy Davolio',          // The author of the comment.
    dateTime: specificDate,           // The date and time when the comment is created.
    isResolved: false                 // The status of the comment; false indicates it is unresolved.
};

// Insert the comment with the specified properties into the document editor.
documentEditor.editor.insertComment('Hello world', commentProperties);
```

## Add a New Comment with Date, Author, and Status

Comments can be inserted into the selected text with a specified date, author, and status `insertComment`.

```typescript
// In this example, a comment with the text "Hello world"
// is added by the author Nancy Davolio on July 23, 2024, at 2:30 PM. 
// The isResolved status is set to false.

// Create a specific date: July 23, 2024, at 2:30:00 PM.
// Note: July is represented by 6 (0-based index).
var specificDate = new Date(2024, 6, 23, 14, 30, 0); 


// Define the properties of the comment including author, date, and resolution status.
var commentProperties = { 
    author: 'Nancy Davolio',          // The author of the comment.
    dateTime: specificDate,           // The date and time when the comment is created.
    isResolved: false                 // The status of the comment; false indicates it is unresolved.
};

// Insert the comment with the specified properties into the document editor.
documentEditor.editor.insertComment('Hello world', commentProperties);
```

## Add a Reply Comment with Date, Author, and Status

Reply comments can be inserted into the parent comment with a specified date, author using `insertReplyComment`.

```typescript
// In this example, a comment with the text "Hello world"
// is added by the author Nancy Davolio on July 23, 2024, at 2:30 PM. 
// The isResolved status is set to false.

// Create a specific date: July 23, 2024, at 2:30:00 PM.
// Note: July is represented by 6 (0-based index).
var specificDate = new Date(2024, 6, 23, 14, 30, 0);

// Define the properties of the comment including author, date, and resolution status.
var commentProperties = { 
    author: 'Nancy Davolio',          // The author of the comment.
    dateTime: specificDate,           // The date and time when the comment is created.
    isResolved: false                 // The status of the comment; false indicates it is unresolved.
};

// Insert the comment with the specified properties into the Document Editor.
var comment = documentEditor.editor.insertComment('Hello world', commentProperties);
// Insert a reply comment with specified properties into the Document Editor
documentEditor.editor.insertReplyComment(comment.id, 'Hello world', commentProperties);
```

## Get Comments

Document Editor allows to get the comments along with its reply and comment properties using `getComments`.

```typescript
//Get Comments in the document along with the properties author, date, status.
var commentinfo = container.documentEditor.getComments();
```

## Comment navigation

Next and previous comments can be navigated using the below code snippet.

```typescript
//Navigate to next comment
documentEditor.selection.navigateNextComment();

//Navigate to previous comment
documentEditor.selection.navigatePreviousComment();
```

## Delete comment

Current comment can be deleted using `deleteComment`.

```typescript
//Delete the current selected comment.
container.documentEditor.editor.deleteComment();

//Get Comments in the document along with the properties author, date, status.
let commentinfo = container.documentEditor.getComments();

//Delete the particular parent comments and all of its reply comments
container.documentEditor.editor.deleteComment(commentinfo[0].id);

//Delete the particular reply comment.
container.documentEditor.editor.deleteComment(commentinfo[0].replies[0].id);
```

## Delete all comment

All the comments in the document can be deleted using the below code snippet.

```typescript
documentEditor.editor.deleteAllComments();
```

## Protect the document in comments only mode

Document Editor provides support for protecting the document with `CommentsOnly` protection. In this protection, user is allowed to add or edit comments alone in the document.

Document editor provides an option to protect and unprotect document using `enforceProtection` and `stopProtection` API.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/document-editor-container/comment-only-protect/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Comment-only.cs" %}
{% endhighlight %}{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/document-editor-container/comment-only-protect/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Comment-only.cs" %}
{% endhighlight %}{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}


Comment only protection can be enabled in UI by using [Restrict Editing pane](../document-editor/document-management#restrict-editing-pane/)

![Enable comment only protection](images/commentsonly.png)

N> In enforce Protection method, first parameter denotes password and second parameter denotes protection type. Possible values of protection type are `NoProtection |ReadOnly |FormFieldsOnly |CommentsOnly`. In stop protection method, parameter denotes the password.

## Mention Support in comments

Mention support displays a list of items that users can select or tag from the suggested list. To use this feature, type the `@` character in the comment box and select or tag the user from the suggestion list.

The following example illustrates how to enable mention support in Document Editor

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/document-editor-container/comments-mention/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="comments-mention.cs" %}
{% endhighlight %}{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/document-editor-container/comments-mention/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="comments-mention.cs" %}
{% endhighlight %}{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}

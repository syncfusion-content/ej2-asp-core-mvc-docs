## Adding the suffix character after selection

You can add the suffix character while selecting an item in the Mention component using [SuffixText](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.DropDowns.Mention.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_DropDowns_Mention_SuffixText) property. You can add space or new line as suffix to the selected item. The default values are empty string.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/mention/customization/suffix-char-customization/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Data.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/mention/customization/suffix-char-customization/SportsData.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Configure the popup list

You can customize the suggestion list as width and height using the [PopupHeight](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.DropDowns.Mention.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_DropDowns_Mention_PopupHeight) and [PopupWidth](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.DropDowns.Mention.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_DropDowns_Mention_PopupWidth) properties.

By default, the popup list width value is set as `auto`. Depending on the mentioned suggestion data list, the width value is automatically adjusted. The popup list height value is set as `300px`.

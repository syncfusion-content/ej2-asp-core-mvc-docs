# Accessibility in Message control

The Message control has been designed keeping in mind the `WAI-ARIA` specifications and applies  [WAI-ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/), states, and properties along with `keyboard support`. This component is characterized by complete keyboard interaction support and ARIA accessibility support, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

## ARIA attributes

The following ARIA attributes are used in the Message:
* alert (role).
* aria-label (attribute).

## Keyboard interaction

The Message functionalities can be interactive with keyboard shortcuts. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Message.

| **Press** | **To do this** |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Tab / Shift + Tab</kbd> | To focus the close icon in the message. |
| <kbd>Enter / Space</kbd> | Closes the focused close icon's message. |

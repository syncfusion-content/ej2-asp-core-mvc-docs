# Accessibility in ASP.NET Core Message control

The Message control followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Message control is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Message control followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Message control:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=alert` | Used to convey a significant and contextual message to the user. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the close icon. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Message control followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Message control.

| **Press** | **To do this** |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Tab / Shift + Tab</kbd> | To focus the close icon in the message. |
| <kbd>Enter / Space</kbd> | Closes the focused close icon's message. |

## Ensuring accessibility

The Message control's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Message control is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/message.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Message control with accessibility tools.

## Data connectivity

The ##Platform_Name## Data Grid integrates with modern application architectures, supporting local collections, REST APIs, GraphQL services, OData endpoints, ORM frameworks, and relational databases.

### Data binding approaches

- **[Local data](./data-binding/local-data)** - Bind grids to local collections and lists for fast data access without external dependencies. Ideal for small to medium datasets and rapid prototyping.

- **[Remote data](./data-binding/remote-data)** - Connect to web services, REST APIs, and remote endpoints with automatic request handling and response parsing. Ideal for scalable applications with large or frequently updated datasets.

- **[Custom API binding](./data-binding/remote-data#binding-observable-data-using-async-pipe)** - Connect the Data Grid to external APIs and data services with full control over request handling, response parsing, and data operations.

- **ORM integration** - Seamless integration with popular Object-Relational Mapping frameworks eliminates custom data mapping code and enables LINQ-based queries.
    - **[Entity Framework](./connecting-to-orm/entityframework)** - Integrate with Entity Framework and EF Core-based applications.
    - **[Dapper](./connecting-to-orm/dapper)** - Connect to applications that use lightweight SQL-based data access.

**Database compatibility**

The Data Grid integrates with major relational databases to provide seamless data access and management:

| Database | Key Benefit | Best For |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **[Microsoft SQL Server](./connecting-to-database/microsoft-sql-server)** | ADO.NET and Entity Framework integration | Enterprise applications, complex queries |
| **[MySQL Server](./connecting-to-database/mysql-server)** | Cross-platform connectivity | Web applications, open-source stacks |
| **[PostgreSQL](./connecting-to-database/postgresql-server)** | Advanced relational features | Large-scale applications, complex data structures |
| **[SQLite](./connecting-to-database/sqlite-server)** | Embedded database | Desktop apps, mobile apps, local storage |

**API and service integration**

API and service integration enables the Data Grid to connect seamlessly with GraphQL, Web API, OData, URL, and custom services for flexible backend data access.

| Integration approach | Best suited for | Key benefit |
|-----------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **[RESTful APIs](./connecting-to-adaptors/url-adaptor)** | Web applications and CRUD-based services | Standard HTTP-based data access |
| **[OData](./connecting-to-adaptors/odatav4-adaptor)** | Queryable enterprise data services | Standardized query and data operations |
| **[GraphQL](./connecting-to-adaptors/graphql-adaptor)** | Applications requiring flexible data queries | Declarative, field-specific data retrieval |
| **[Custom APIs](./data-binding/remote-data)** | Connect applications with external APIs or services | Complete control over server-side data operations and request handling |

## Data operations

The ##Platform_Name## Data Grid includes key features that make it easier to work with and understand large sets of information. These capabilities support organizing records, locating information efficiently, and summarizing results to enable clear analysis of complex datasets.

- **[Sorting](./sorting)** - Arrange records in ascending or descending order to quickly identify trends and patterns.
- **[Filter bar](./filtering/filter-bar)** - Apply inline text filters in column headers for immediate results without dialogs.  
- **[Filter menu](./filtering/filter-menu)** - Use advanced filtering with complex conditions and multiple criteria for powerful expression-based queries. 
- **[Excel-like filter](./filtering/excel-like-filter)** - Filter with a familiar checkbox interface, allowing multi-select from available values.  
- **[Searching](./searching)** - Perform rapid text-based searches across one or multiple columns for global or column-specific results. 
- **[Grouping](./grouping/grouping)** - Organize records into categories with multi-level hierarchical grouping for better comprehension. 
- **[Aggregates](./aggregates/aggregates)** - Calculate and display summary values (sum, average, min, max, custom metrics) to gain real-time insights.

## Large-scale rendering performance

The ##Platform_Name## Data Grid is designed for high performance, ensuring smooth interaction with large datasets. It uses built-in DOM virtualization with paging or virtual scrolling to load data on demand. This approach minimizes memory usage and reduces rendering overhead by limiting the number of active DOM elements, delivering responsive navigation and seamless scrolling even with very large datasets.

## Editing and CRUD operations

The ##Platform_Name## Data Grid enables seamless Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations directly within the grid interface, eliminating the need for separate forms or pages. Data modification occurs inline with immediate visual feedback, improving productivity and reducing context switching.

**Editing modes**

Multiple editing modes support different workflow scenarios:

| Mode | Description | Best for | Key benefit |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **[In-line editing](./editing/in-line-editing)** | Edit records directly within grid rows | Simple updates and streamlined workflows | Minimal context switching and faster editing |
| **[Dialog editing](./editing/dialog-editing)** | Edit records in a dedicated dialog form | Multi-field data entry | Structured form-based editing with additional space |
| **[Batch editing](./editing/batch-editing)** | Make multiple changes before saving them together | High-volume editing | Efficient commits with fewer server requests |
| **[Cell editing](./editing/cell-editing)** | Edit individual cells within the grid | Frequent data entry, precision-focused editing | Precise cell-level editing and rapid data updates |

**Data validation**

Built-in [validation](./editing/validation) rules such as required fields, minimum and maximum values, and numeric-only checks ensure consistent data accuracy. In addition, custom validation rules provide flexibility to define tailored logic for specific business requirements, validating input before changes are saved.

## Columns

The ##Platform_Name## Data Grid provides flexible column and layout customization with formatting, resizing, reordering, and visibility controls for professional displays.

- **[Column formatting](./columns/columns)** - Apply predefined or custom formats (currency, dates, percentages) for professional number and date presentation.  
- **[Column resizing](./columns/column-resizing)** - Adjust widths manually with auto-fit and responsive options for optimal visibility. 
- **[Column reordering](./columns/column-reorder)** - Drag headers to reorder columns for preferred arrangement. 
- **[Frozen columns](./columns/frozen-column)** - Keep key columns visible during horizontal scrolling for critical information access.
- **[Column spanning](./columns/column-spanning)** - Extend cells across multiple columns to create grouped or summary layouts. 
- **[Column menu](./columns/column-menu)** - Use dropdowns for visibility, filtering, sorting, grouping, and autofit for quick management.

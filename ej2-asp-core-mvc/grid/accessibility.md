## Ensuring accessibility

The Grid component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Grid component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/grid.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Grid component with accessibility tools.

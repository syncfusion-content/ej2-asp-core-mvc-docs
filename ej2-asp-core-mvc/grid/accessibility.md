# Accessibility in ASP.NET MVC Grid control

Accessibility is achieved in the Grid component through WAI-ARIA standard and keyboard navigations. The Grid features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the Grid:

* grid (role)
* row (role)
* gridcell (role)
* aria-selected (attribute)
* aria-expanded (attribute)
* aria-sort (attribute)
* aria-busy (attribute)
* aria-invalid (attribute)
* aria-grabbed (attribute)
* aria-owns (attribute)
* aria-label (attribute)

N> You can achieve a single table announcing on the JAWS screen reader by setting an **`e-gridcell-read`** class through [cssClass](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Buttons.Button.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Buttons_Button_CssClass) property of the grid.

## Keyboard navigation

Grid functionalities can be interactive with keyboard shortcuts. In order to utilize all the available keyboard shortcuts, the [`EnableHeaderFocus`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_EnableHeaderFocus) property of the Grid needs to be set as **true**.

The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Grid.

# Overview

The DropDownList control contains a list of predefined values from which a single value can be chosen. The functionality of DropDownList resembles the SELECT form element of HTML. When an arrow icon accompanied with this control is pressed, the dropdown displays a list of values from which you can select one.

## Key features

* **[Data binding](/drop-down-list/data-binding.html)** - Allows binding and accessing the list of items from local or server-side data source.

* **[Grouping](/drop-down-list/grouping.html)** - Supports grouping of logically related items under a single or specific category.

* **[Sorting](/drop-down-list/api-dropDownList.html#sortorder-sortorder)** - Supports sorting of list items in an alphabetical order (either ascending or descending).

* **[Filtering](/drop-down-list/filtering.html)** - Allows filtering of list items based on a character typed into the search box.

# Overview

The **TreeView** control is used to represent hierarchical data in a tree like structure with advanced functions to edit, drag and drop, select with CheckBox and more. TreeView can be populated from a data source such as an array of JavaScript objects or from DataManager.

## Key features

* **[Data Binding](data-binding/)**: Binds the TreeView control with an array of JavaScript objects or `DataManager`.

* **[CheckBox](check-box/)**: Allows you to select more than one node in TreeView without affecting the UI appearance.

* **[Drag and Drop](drag-and-drop/)**: Allows you to drag and drop any node in TreeView.

* **[Multi Selection](multiple-selection/)**: Allows you to select more than one node in TreeView.

* **[Node Editing](node-editing/)**: Allows you to change the text of a node in TreeView.

* **[Sorting](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Navigations.TreeView~SortOrder.html)**: Allows display of the TreeView nodes in an `ascending` or a `descending` order.

* **[Template](template/)**: Allows you to customize the nodes in TreeView.

* **[Accessibility](accessibility/)**: Provides built-in accessibility support that helps to access all the TreeView control features through the keyboard, on-screen readers, or other assistive technology devices.

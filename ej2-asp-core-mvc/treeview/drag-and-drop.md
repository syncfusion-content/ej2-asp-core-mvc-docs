# Drag and Drop

The TreeView control allows you to drag and drop any node by setting the [allowDragAndDrop](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Navigations.TreeView~AllowDragAndDrop.html) to **true**. Nodes can be dragged and dropped at all levels of the same TreeView. 

The dragged nodes can be dropped at any level by indicator lines with **line**, **plus/minus**, and **restrict** icons. It represents the exact position where the node is to be dropped as sibling or child.

The following table explains the usage of indicator icons.

| Icons | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Plus icon | Indicates that the dragged node is to be added as child of target node. |
| Minus or restrict icon |Indicates that the dragged node is not to be dropped at the hovered region. |
| In-between icon | Indicates that the dragged node is to be added as siblings of hovered region. |

* To prevent dragging action for a particular node, you can use the [`nodeDragStart`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Navigations.TreeView~NodeDragStart.html) event, which is triggered when the node drag is started. If you need to prevent dropping action for a particular node, the [`nodeDragStop`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Navigations.TreeView.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Navigations_TreeView_NodeDragStop) event can be used which is triggered when the drag is stopped.

* The [`nodeDragging`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Navigations.TreeView~NodeDragging.html) event is triggered when the TreeView node is being dragged. You can customize the cloned element in this event.

* The [`nodeDropped`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Navigations.TreeView~NodeDropped.html) event is triggered when the TreeView node is dropped on the target element successfully.

In the following sample, the [allowDragAndDrop](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Navigations.TreeView~AllowDragAndDrop.html) property is enabled.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/treeview/draganddrop/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Draganddrop.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/treeview/draganddrop/draganddrop.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/treeview/draganddrop/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Draganddrop.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/treeview/draganddrop/draganddrop.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}



The output will look like the image below:

## Multiple-node drag and drop

To drag and drop more than one node, you should enable both the [allowMultiSelection](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Navigations.TreeView~AllowMultiSelection.html) and [allowDragAndDrop](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Navigations.TreeView~AllowDragAndDrop.html) properties. 

To perform multi-selection, press and hold **CTRL** key and click the desired nodes. To select a range of nodes, press and hold the **SHIFT** key and click the nodes. 

In the following sample,  the `allowMultiSelection` property is  enabled along with the `allowDragAndDrop` property.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/treeview/draganddrop/multidraganddrop/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Draganddrop.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/treeview/draganddrop/multidraganddrop/draganddrop.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/treeview/draganddrop/multidraganddrop/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="Draganddrop.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/treeview/draganddrop/multidraganddrop/draganddrop.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}



The output will look like the image below:

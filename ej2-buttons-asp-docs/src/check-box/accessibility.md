# Accessibility

The web accessibility makes web content and web applications more accessible for people with disabilities. It especially helps in dynamic content change and development of advanced user interface controls with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.
CheckBox provides built-in compliance with `WAI-ARIA` specifications. `WAI-ARIA` support is achieved through the attributes like `aria-checked` and `aria-disabled`. It helps the people with disabilities by providing information about the widget for assistive
technology in the screen readers. CheckBox component contains the `checkbox` role.

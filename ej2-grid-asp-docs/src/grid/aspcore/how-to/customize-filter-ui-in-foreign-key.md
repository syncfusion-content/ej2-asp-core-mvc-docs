# Customize filter UI in foreign key column

You can create your own filtering UI by using [`filter`](https://helpsyncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/aspnetcore/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.GridColumn~Filter.html) property of [`e-grid-column`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.GridColumn.html) tag helper. The following example demonstrates the way to create a custom filtering UI in the foreign column.

In the following example, The **Employee Name** is a foreign key column. DropDownList is rendered using Filter UI.

{% aspTab template="grid/how-to/filter-ui-foreign", sourceFiles="filter-ui-foreign.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

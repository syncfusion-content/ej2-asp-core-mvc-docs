# Show or Hide columns in Dialog editing

You can show hidden columns or hide visible column's editor in the dialog while editing the grid record using [`ActionBegin`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_ActionBegin) and [`ActionComplete`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_ActionComplete) events.

In the [`ActionBegin`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_ActionBegin) event, based on **requestType** as **beginEdit** or  **add**. We can show or hide the editor by using [`Visible`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.GridColumn.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_GridColumn_Visible) property of [`Column`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.GridColumn.html).

In the [`ActionComplete`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_ActionComplete) event, based on **requestType** as **save**. We can reset the properties back to the column state.

In the below example, we have rendered the grid columns **CustomerID** as hidden column and **ShipCountry** as visible column. In the edit mode, we have changed the **CustomerID** column to visible state and **ShipCountry** column to hidden state.

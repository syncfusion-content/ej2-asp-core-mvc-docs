# Passing additional parameters to the server when Exporting

You can pass the additional parameter in the `query` property by invoking `addParams` method. In the `toolbarClick` event, you can define params as key and value pair so it will receive at the server side when exporting.

In the below example, we have passed `recordcount` as `12` using `addParams` method.
